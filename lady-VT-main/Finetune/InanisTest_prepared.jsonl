{"prompt":"certain games when they have sequels, ->","completion":" it's kind of like not up to the fan bases expectations or like, it kind of takes away from,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" the goodness of the original, what not.\n"}
{"prompt":"But then I heard good things about God of War where people were like, ->","completion":" yeah, this is,\n"}
{"prompt":"this is how you make a sequel and stuff like that. ->","completion":" So, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" That's like one of the reasons why I liked the original Gundam series, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" cause older anime, they ran for longer periods of time,\n"}
{"prompt":"like they had a lot more episodes. ->","completion":" But seeing, for example,\n"}
{"prompt":"Amuro from when he first started, ->","completion":" how he was just like another rebellious bratty kid to like his like mature and leadership and char's counterattack, like that's how a character grows up.\n"}
{"prompt":"That's how characters grow up. ->","completion":" After the bright slap. Wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"isn't my ruler not working? ->","completion":" Because it hasn't been working for a while, huh?\n"}
{"prompt":"What happened to this? ->","completion":" My symmetry ruler hasn't been working. What's going on?\n"}
{"prompt":"Did I disable the mistake? ->","completion":" I might have. Elect object,\n"}
{"prompt":"there we go. ->","completion":" Now if it's disabled, it should be green.\n"}
{"prompt":"So only when editing target, ->","completion":" show in all layers, show in same folder.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's not working. ->","completion":" I mean, I've done the important parts that needed the ruler,\n"}
{"prompt":"so it's fine, ->","completion":" but that's weird. What about if it shows in all layers?\n"}
{"prompt":"Still doesn't work. ->","completion":" Interesting. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" it's stopped working for some reason. That's fine.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's alright. ->","completion":" I did the hard part already. Did I finish wish for Mercury?\n"}
{"prompt":"I did. ->","completion":" I don't know if it's been long enough that it's okay to talk about it. Maybe not,\n"}
{"prompt":"but um. ->","completion":" Hmm. Second season when?\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm curious. ->","completion":" I'm curious. Is it still recording?\n"}
{"prompt":"It is. ->","completion":" April? Oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"that's relatively soon. ->","completion":" I'm just, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"like I'm okay. ->","completion":" So like there's like, I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"I guess we can talk about like random theories that people were talking about, ->","completion":" right? Um,\n"}
{"prompt":"because there has been hints where she's like talking to Ariel, ->","completion":" but then people were saying it says that she's talking to like a group of people or like a different entity. And it's just like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ah, ->","completion":" and people were like saying how this was like, like so and so much years after the prologue,\n"}
{"prompt":"but then like it doesn't match up to, ->","completion":" uh, Sleeta's age and what not.\n"}
{"prompt":"So it's just like. ->","completion":" Is this the clue? Is this foreshadowing?\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" Like, I'm curious.\n"}
{"prompt":"I want to know. ->","completion":" I want to know. They hid some stuff in the first season.\n"}
{"prompt":"I might have to rewatch it to kind of, ->","completion":" you know, digest it a little better,\n"}
{"prompt":"but. ->","completion":" Hmm. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Curious. ->","completion":" Curious. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like, ->","completion":" I think they did a good job in that they really built up kind of like the, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"the usual people in space, ->","completion":" you know, they go to school,\n"}
{"prompt":"they battle in their mobile suits, ->","completion":" Gundams, what not.\n"}
{"prompt":"It kind of like was like a, ->","completion":" oh, it's going to be like a light,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" slightly with like some political conflict kind of anime. And then they pull the last episode.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's just like. ->","completion":" Okay, what's next?\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" she refers to them as Mina and I'm just like, okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"there's two theories on that, ->","completion":" right? Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay, ->","completion":" like. There is multiple entities like in Ariel or two,\n"}
{"prompt":"she's just referring to Mina as in like the funnels because there's a lot of them. ->","completion":" She's just like, Mina,\n"}
{"prompt":"let's go. ->","completion":" Yeah, funnels.\n"}
{"prompt":"But like, ->","completion":" I feel like, I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"It could be both. ->","completion":" It could be both. But I feel like we'll get some clarifications with like more episodes.\n"}
{"prompt":"So I'm just waiting patiently now. ->","completion":" Yeah. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's cute. ->","completion":" I might have to watch the prologue again. Because you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"those who, ->","completion":" those have the what the gun, gun arm was it,\n"}
{"prompt":"like their system, ->","completion":" like they have like the little weird glowing marks when they write the Gundam, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"But then like, ->","completion":" Sureta, like even when she was a kid,\n"}
{"prompt":"she didn't have that. ->","completion":" Did she? I don't think she did.\n"}
{"prompt":"What if there's like a secret behind the birth too, ->","completion":" like what's, what's,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's going on? ->","completion":" Oh, Eddie did have them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Okay, ->","completion":" okay. So this,\n"}
{"prompt":"this brings up different stories because Sureta doesn't have them. ->","completion":" Does Sureta get them? She does?\n"}
{"prompt":"Or does she not? ->","completion":" I'm so, I might have to look back on the series again.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm pretty sure she didn't. ->","completion":" Yeah, that's the thing,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" Sureta doesn't have them, but Eddie did.\n"}
{"prompt":"That means they might not be the same body at least, ->","completion":" right? Right?\n"}
{"prompt":"Everyone has red, ->","completion":" but Eddie had blue. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's like, ->","completion":" I'm curious, curious.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm curious how they're gonna, ->","completion":" how they're gonna unfold the story here then. That would explain like the age,\n"}
{"prompt":"like the years difference, ->","completion":" age difference between Eddie and Sureta, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"And maybe that's why like the mom is like so almost like robotic towards Sureta, ->","completion":" because technically not Eddie, like if they're different people.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because like there were, ->","completion":" there were hints too, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"Where, ->","completion":" where she, the mom mentioned like thought,\n"}
{"prompt":"not like a single daughter, ->","completion":" but daughters. So what if,\n"}
{"prompt":"what if Eddie is somehow like integrated into Ariel now and Sureta is just like a clone? ->","completion":" But that's the thing, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"They also like, ->","completion":" no, no,\n"}
{"prompt":"think about it though. ->","completion":" They also have, what's his name?\n"}
{"prompt":"The, ->","completion":" the, the character,\n"}
{"prompt":"the clone character. ->","completion":" Aran? Aran?\n"}
{"prompt":"Aran? ->","completion":" Aran-san? Aran.\n"}
{"prompt":"Right? ->","completion":" He's also, I feel like he's also like a,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's it, ->","completion":" foreshadowing in a way, the clones.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because technically like whoever like created that system too, ->","completion":" right? Also worked on like,\n"}
{"prompt":"like Ariel, ->","completion":" pro-Ariel, pro-type Ariel,\n"}
{"prompt":"I forgot what that one was called, ->","completion":" right? Right?\n"}
{"prompt":"Right? ->","completion":" Okay, think of,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay, ->","completion":" okay, okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"think about it here. ->","completion":" So, but then she wasn't like the,\n"}
{"prompt":"the one in charge, ->","completion":" the one in charge was kind of like the, like Sureta's mom,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" But they still knew about the technology, so they were like,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay, ->","completion":" maybe we can, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"lower like the, ->","completion":" what's it, like the pressure gives to the pilot by like using some kind of clone technology or whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt":"But then the thing is like, ->","completion":" Aran, the first Aran isn't a clone,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" It's just a person who got like a face plastic surgery to match the real dude. But then if you think about it in a different way,\n"}
{"prompt":"if there's a compatible pilot and they create a clone of them, ->","completion":" then they don't get physically affected by the limitations of having the Gundam system. That's why Sureta doesn't have the marks.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" Hmm. And what if like something went wrong like back in the past that we don't know the missing years between Sureta and Eddie.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like something, ->","completion":" something might have gone wrong or something might have affected Eddie's like actual body because Eddie showed the marks. So she's like part or her soul is in Ariel or something.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then she has, ->","completion":" you know, since they're technically the same person because Sureta would be the clone of Eddie.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like that's why Sureta can pilot Ariel without any, ->","completion":" you know, repercussions.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" Maybe that's why they have to rename it to Ariel, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe, ->","completion":" maybe the mom was like a math scientist in the end. Like she went kind of crazy after,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" the events of the prologue and kind of like saw the potential to make like the perfect system with Eddie. And she created Ariel from the,\n"}
{"prompt":"from merging Eddie with the, ->","completion":" what's the name, if whatever first name of the thing was.\n"}
{"prompt":"That could be possible. ->","completion":" Because you know those types of like intense science, scientist kind of characters almost look like they look like they have emotion,\n"}
{"prompt":"but like the way that her mom acted throughout the series, ->","completion":" it looked like she was kind of like the math like emotion. The emotionless scientist.\n"}
{"prompt":"I wouldn't be, ->","completion":" I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled that on us. Like the way that she acted towards Sureta in the last episode too,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's just like so robotic. ->","completion":" Like it was a tone of like a, I only see science kind of tone.\n"}
{"prompt":"So that's my thought on how this series is gonna go. ->","completion":" That kind of, that would be an interesting,\n"}
{"prompt":"interesting story wise though. ->","completion":" I feel like, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Another theory is the mom is Eddie. ->","completion":" That, that could also be possible.\n"}
{"prompt":"In a way, ->","completion":" theory wise. Like what if,\n"}
{"prompt":"what if the effects of Gund arm that Eddie faced was not like you know just dying what not, ->","completion":" but it had her age. I mean this is a weaker theory,\n"}
{"prompt":"this is a weaker theory than the first one. ->","completion":" But what if the effect of the Gund arm instead of you know like taking away her feelings and all her body what not, it like made her older faster.\n"}
{"prompt":"You know it's a theory, ->","completion":" it's theory, it's not,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's not true, ->","completion":" it's theory. So yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"There has mentioned being El Mora to the Dying Space though. ->","completion":" That's the thing like you can't, you can't,\n"}
{"prompt":"you can't rule out anything until it happens. ->","completion":" Right? It's just one of many many theories.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like you don't know what they're gonna pull, ->","completion":" they might just pull like a, all of a sudden you can turn into,\n"}
{"prompt":"you can turn into a god in a Gundam. ->","completion":" You know, you can become the Gundam.\n"}
{"prompt":"You never know. ->","completion":" It happened before, so you can never tell.\n"}
{"prompt":"But I feel like, ->","completion":" I feel like the first, first theory I was talking about is,\n"}
{"prompt":"it seems a little likely like the way Sureta refers to, ->","completion":" Um, Minna.\n"}
{"prompt":"For example, ->","completion":" Sureta might not be the first clone. Like there might be many,\n"}
{"prompt":"many clones that her mom, ->","completion":" you know, maybe created until she got to the perfect clone,\n"}
{"prompt":"which was Sureta, ->","completion":" right? That's why all the,\n"}
{"prompt":"all the thoughts and all these souls before, ->","completion":" they're all merged into aerial. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"That would be dark, ->","completion":" but seeing how the first season ended, I wouldn't be surprised.\n"}
{"prompt":"I wouldn't be surprised. ->","completion":" I really hope they really go all in on the dark side of the story. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Gundam being dark, they don't do that right.\n"}
{"prompt":"I mean, ->","completion":" you know. I feel like season two is definitely gonna be a lot darker,\n"}
{"prompt":"theme-wise. ->","completion":" And uh, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I would kind of like to see that happen. ->","completion":" I kind of hope for it. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's nice to have plot twists like that. ->","completion":" Ironblooded orphans. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't know how I feel about Ironblooded orphans. ->","completion":" I didn't finish the series. I'll be honest with you.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm not sure. ->","completion":" I think something didn't really click right with me for some of the characters. I'm not sure.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" usually if I like the characters in it, I do try to continue it,\n"}
{"prompt":"but I'm not sure. ->","completion":" I'm not sure if I really felt any connection or liking to the characters in it. Which is why I didn't finish it fully,\n"}
{"prompt":"I think. ->","completion":" Well, the clothes are good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Gundam design though. ->","completion":" But I don't know. Something about it just felt off to me.\n"}
{"prompt":"I can't really pinpoint it though. ->","completion":" I mean, first season was decent.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think I stopped somewhere in the mid-season of second one. ->","completion":" I don't know. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I've heard it was good, ->","completion":" but yeah. I don't know.\n"}
{"prompt":"You know what I'm really looking forward to though? ->","completion":" Hathaway. I'm very much looking forward to that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" I would rewatch the first movie all over again. It's just so good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" that's the kind of darkness I like in the Gundam series. Ugh.\n"}
{"prompt":"You know, ->","completion":" like... Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Some mystery, ->","completion":" some darkness. Some characters growing up,\n"}
{"prompt":"some not growing up. ->","completion":" It's like the right amount. Perfect balance.\n"}
{"prompt":"On top of that, ->","completion":" you know, Hiroyuki Sawano soundtrack.\n"}
{"prompt":"Great animation. ->","completion":" Man, I still think back to that fight scene in the park.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" I've seen a lot of mecha anime. I've seen...\n"}
{"prompt":"I've seen a lot of Gundam series, ->","completion":" but that sequence was the sequence that really made me feel the, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"the horrifying scene of if actual, ->","completion":" you know, giant robots for fighting and people were trying to run for their lives.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like... ->","completion":" the scale, the music,\n"}
{"prompt":"atmosphere, ->","completion":" drama, just perfectly done.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like... ->","completion":" Yeah. That's a good scene.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" and the whole build up when... How do you read that?\n"}
{"prompt":"See, ->","completion":" right? When see,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" Hathaway was going up to the place to drop down. The whole build up.\n"}
{"prompt":"The soundtrack. ->","completion":" Oh, so good.\n"}
{"prompt":"I want to rewatch it. ->","completion":" Maybe I'll rewatch it tonight or something. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"the chills. ->","completion":" And then when, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"the hand just goes down and, ->","completion":" like, grabs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Ha ha ha. ->","completion":" Like, you can feel your heart just,\n"}
{"prompt":"like... ->","completion":" Yeah, if you guys want to rewatch the,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" Hathaway, we have the members watch along with it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" I don't know, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"when it comes to anime... ->","completion":" Oh, I think I need to draw.\n"}
{"prompt":"When it comes to anime series that I watched a while ago. ->","completion":" I sometimes don't remember, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"the details. ->","completion":" I had to go back and, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"rewrite, ->","completion":" like, all the things that happened in the UC timeline up to Hathaway.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think that was, ->","completion":" like, the review thing I did with,\n"}
{"prompt":"um, ->","completion":" before the Hathaway movie. But then,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" I still don't remember a lot. I have to have to rewatch it,\n"}
{"prompt":"but some of the older series has, ->","completion":" like, a lot of,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's it, ->","completion":" a lot of episodes. It takes a long time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alright, ->","completion":" this is the drawing stream. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh. ->","completion":" Yeah, that's just the beauty of the UC timeline,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" Cause, oh yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"we watched, ->","completion":" uh, Shory's counterattack before Hathaway.\n"}
{"prompt":"Did we do? ->","completion":" I think we did. Cause it kind of would relate to Hathaway's flash,\n"}
{"prompt":"so... ->","completion":" Yeah. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I really liked it when they inserted that flashback scene by Hathaway. ->","completion":" Except it was, like,\n"}
{"prompt":"redrawn to, ->","completion":" like, the recent style,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" to match Hathaway's style. But then,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" you know which scene it was, cause...\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Ah, it looks so good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sorry. ->","completion":" But yeah. That scene was great.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" oh, oh.\n"}
{"prompt":"It makes watch-alongs with E9 tacos? ->","completion":" We should, we should watch something sometime.\n"}
{"prompt":"Anime voice. ->","completion":" Yeah, good series.\n"}
{"prompt":"Members watch along stream again? ->","completion":" Yeah, I've been thinking about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like, ->","completion":" which series would I like to watch? What would be nice if it was a series I haven't...\n"}
{"prompt":"What's it? ->","completion":" I haven't watched yet. I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't like rewatching, ->","completion":" but... Am I gonna tell you guys about the tar records?\n"}
{"prompt":"This is more of a girl's story, ->","completion":" but... Maybe I won't.\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe I won't. ->","completion":" I don't know if she's gonna talk about it, but,\n"}
{"prompt":"like... ->","completion":" Yeah, I was gonna say,\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm just gonna say it. ->","completion":" So, when we walked into tar records that one time,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" You guys, remember when I talked about when I was walking down the,\n"}
{"prompt":"um... ->","completion":" Randomly down Akiba, and they started playing Holy and Ochame Kino?\n"}
{"prompt":"This time, ->","completion":" I went to tar records. As soon as we stepped into,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" the hearing range of tar records, they started playing right on time.\n"}
{"prompt":"They started playing right on time. ->","completion":" Like, it just started playing as we,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" stepped in. We're just like...\n"}
{"prompt":"And Grand and I kind of, ->","completion":" like, looked at each other.\n"}
{"prompt":"We're just like... ->","completion":" What are the chances? It was because,\n"}
{"prompt":"um, ->","completion":" I think he released a, um...\n"}
{"prompt":"Best of album recently? ->","completion":" Probably, I think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"So, ->","completion":" they had it on display, and that's probably why they were playing it.\n"}
{"prompt":"But out of all the songs... ->","completion":" All the songs that they could have played from the album, we played right on time.\n"}
{"prompt":"That was so funny. ->","completion":" But I guess we definitely were, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"right on time to hear the song. ->","completion":" Oh, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I didn't want to watch Tenant with you guys. ->","completion":" That was the one movie I said I wanted to watch. Because I need to do a lot of thinking and understanding,\n"}
{"prompt":"and I need a lot of brain cells, ->","completion":" and I need you guys for that movie. I was gonna try watching it myself,\n"}
{"prompt":"but I was like, ->","completion":" no, no,\n"}
{"prompt":"no, ->","completion":" no, I'm not gonna understand it.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm not gonna understand it. ->","completion":" I need, I need,\n"}
{"prompt":"I need the tacos brain cells. ->","completion":" You have to brainstorm, see,\n"}
{"prompt":"understand what's going on. ->","completion":" So, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"That's a very complicated, ->","completion":" you know, movie to understand.\n"}
{"prompt":"But isn't, ->","completion":" isn't he also releasing another movie this year? What's it,\n"}
{"prompt":"Openheimer? ->","completion":" I'm kind of, I heard that like,\n"}
{"prompt":"he really likes doing practical effects. ->","completion":" And, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I wonder, ->","completion":" I'm curious to see what they came up with for, what you might call it,\n"}
{"prompt":"like the practical effect side of things. ->","completion":" Yeah. Wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"there are some that I haven't watched that he made. ->","completion":" What's the other one? Dunkirk?\n"}
{"prompt":"Dunkirk was also by Christopher Nolan? ->","completion":" That's his name? No,\n"}
{"prompt":"no, ->","completion":" is it? There are a couple of,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah, ->","completion":" yeah, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Interstellar I watched too many times. ->","completion":" I haven't watched Dunkirk and Tenet as the other one that I haven't watched. Um,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's the other one? ->","completion":" I mean, Inception everyone watched,\n"}
{"prompt":"Interstellar I watched. ->","completion":" Well, I thought I was the most damn.\n"}
{"prompt":"Batman. ->","completion":" Prestige, oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"I love prestige. ->","completion":" Prestige is great. Memento?\n"}
{"prompt":"Memento, ->","completion":" I feel like that. That's good.\n"}
{"prompt":"What's that? ->","completion":" What's that? Prestige,\n"}
{"prompt":"Memento, ->","completion":" Memento, moving.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" this is the one where, um,\n"}
{"prompt":"what you might call it? ->","completion":" He doesn't even have a tattoo over his body trying to remember stuff. I'm pretty sure I watched this one.\n"}
{"prompt":"It was a really long time ago. ->","completion":" Yeah, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I must have watched this one. ->","completion":" At least Malani's and Papani's showed us a lot of movies. I didn't know the title of them when we were little.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like Anani Senai, ->","completion":" we would just be like sitting down on the couch. Like Malani's Papani's will sit us down and just like,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay, ->","completion":" we're watching a movie. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Wait, let me see all the movies by Christopher.\n"}
{"prompt":"I must have watched a lot of it because... ->","completion":" Alright, where's the,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's it? ->","completion":" IMDB, all the films.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" yeah, Malani's and Papani's,\n"}
{"prompt":"they really, ->","completion":" they really want us to watch a lot of movies. They like movies,\n"}
{"prompt":"we like movies too, ->","completion":" so that's what happened a lot when we were little. I've been working on a Japanese English pickup plan for about a month this year,\n"}
{"prompt":"but I think the delivery needs a little work. ->","completion":" Can you help me out? The line I've got is this.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hey, ->","completion":" you wanna go on a romantic train ride and go chuu chuu with me? Okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"that's a good one. ->","completion":" That's a good one. Wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"do I have a IMDB page? ->","completion":" Ni no mai nanis. I'm an actress.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm an actress. ->","completion":" I'm an actress, guys.\n"}
{"prompt":"Known for umishi. ->","completion":" Also known for can you do the hollow live and turning like a thousand years. Oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"and many other songs. ->","completion":" I'm a Google certified musical artist and IMDB certified actress. Oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"I got tears in my eyes. ->","completion":" Inception interstellar prestige. Oh yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"wasn't it? ->","completion":" What's it? Like when they filmed interstellar,\n"}
{"prompt":"they said like we didn't have like an actual picture of a black hole, ->","completion":" right? But then they consulted a lot of like,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" professionals in that area. And they created like the coolest thing they think to what black hole look like an interstellar.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then like a little bit later, ->","completion":" they actually were able to take a picture of the black hole. The physicists.\n"}
{"prompt":"And it was actually really close to, ->","completion":" you know, the ones in interstellar.\n"}
{"prompt":"So people are pretty, ->","completion":" pretty impressed. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" What's it? Dunkirk Justice League,\n"}
{"prompt":"executive producer. ->","completion":" Batman vs Superman? Martha.\n"}
{"prompt":"How do you know her name? ->","completion":" Men of Steel. I don't watch that.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's too late. ->","completion":" I already watched it. Why did you say that name?\n"}
{"prompt":"Dark Knight. ->","completion":" I guess there's a couple I haven't watched. Why is the memento on this list?\n"}
{"prompt":"Weird. ->","completion":" But yeah. Why did you say that name?\n"}
{"prompt":"Martha. ->","completion":" Martha. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Memento, ->","completion":" maybe they forgot about it. Chill,\n"}
{"prompt":"chill. ->","completion":" Alright. Knives out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Is that the um... ->","completion":" um... um...\n"}
{"prompt":"A whole bunch of people trying to kill each other one? ->","completion":" Ah, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"the murder mystery kind of thing. ->","completion":" Oh, it's a who done it one?\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe I'm thinking of something else. ->","completion":" Probably. I'm probably missing some of them.\n"}
{"prompt":"Murder mystery. ->","completion":" What's it? What's it?\n"}
{"prompt":"What was that one movie I really enjoyed watching with my family? ->","completion":" I think we watched it... DVD or theaters?\n"}
{"prompt":"It's so hard to remember which one I watched in theaters when I watched... ->","completion":" DVD. But...\n"}
{"prompt":"What's that one? ->","completion":" The one where like the whole world freezes over? And like,\n"}
{"prompt":"was it? ->","completion":" I think like the dad was trying to like get to his son who was in college or whatever? What's that one called?\n"}
{"prompt":"Day after tomorrow? ->","completion":" Oh yeah, day after tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" that's what it was. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Actually like this train does that stuff. ->","completion":" You know, should I give up trying to?\n"}
{"prompt":"I feel like I should just... ->","completion":" Yeah. I'm gonna stop turning.\n"}
{"prompt":"Turning into always have been. ->","completion":" Alright, we're just gonna talk with the rest of the chiefs.\n"}
{"prompt":"Alright, ->","completion":" should we go to her? Should we go to her?\n"}
{"prompt":"No, ->","completion":" I think we can still stay for people who wanna see the artwork. Okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"I'll have it right here. ->","completion":" No, no,\n"}
{"prompt":"but then that movie was pretty good. ->","completion":" But I was watching like behind the scenes and movies and how they were shot randomly on YouTube recently. And that movie was covered and they were like,\n"}
{"prompt":"oh yeah, ->","completion":" that whole movie was actually filmed like in the summer or something and they had to pretend it was cold. Like they were super hot and all the gear and something,\n"}
{"prompt":"but they had to pretend it was cold. ->","completion":" That's like their acting was super good. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"sounds rough, ->","completion":" it really does. Cause it was like a movie about like,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" freezing to death when, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"Earth all freezes over and whatnot. ->","completion":" So yeah. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"What else is the movie I remember? ->","completion":" I think a lot of movies like that end up being like that. Another thing I watched was actually like,\n"}
{"prompt":"what was it? ->","completion":" Train to Busan? Like they couldn't actually rent the train.\n"}
{"prompt":"So they built like a one to one scale set, ->","completion":" right? Like all the staff of the movie,\n"}
{"prompt":"they rode the train multiple times. ->","completion":" Hmm. And apparently they didn't have air conditioning in the set.\n"}
{"prompt":"So all the sweat you see in like people acting, ->","completion":" it's real. Like they're really sweating it out in the set.\n"}
{"prompt":"But it made it look more natural though, ->","completion":" I think. Apparently it was like super close to the actual train.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" But they were sweating and acting and whatnot. They must have been super,\n"}
{"prompt":"super stuffy in there. ->","completion":" Yeah. There's a sequel?\n"}
{"prompt":"I didn't know there was a sequel. ->","completion":" Yeah. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's animated, ->","completion":" huh? Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"How many people know about it? ->","completion":" Probably if they didn't like... If it didn't reach my ears,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's probably not that great. ->","completion":" It's probably not that great. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" I mean if it was good and everyone talked about it, I probably would have heard about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"But like, ->","completion":" that's the thing, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"When I don't really go out to look at what movies are out, ->","completion":" etc. Like I hear it by word of mouth,\n"}
{"prompt":"like through SNS, ->","completion":" whatnot. And if it was really,\n"}
{"prompt":"really bad people would talk about it. ->","completion":" If it was really, really good people would talk about it.\n"}
{"prompt":"But if it's kind of just, ->","completion":" you know, in the middle of the pack,\n"}
{"prompt":"not many people actually talk about it as much. ->","completion":" Like for example, a certain movie relatively recently got very bad reviews,\n"}
{"prompt":"but it became a meme for how, ->","completion":" you know, people rated it.\n"}
{"prompt":"So it became the talk of the month. ->","completion":" You know? That's the thing,\n"}
{"prompt":"you hear about it? ->","completion":" If it's, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"like that, ->","completion":" but if you don't, then it doesn't.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" I don't know. I really wish that they built on,\n"}
{"prompt":"like one movie that I wish that they built on was actually a DC character, ->","completion":" like the, what's it?\n"}
{"prompt":"I wish they built on the Suicide Squad's version of Joker and Harley Quinn. ->","completion":" Because it just showed up as like a short flashback in the first Suicide Squad movie, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"But I feel like it could have been an interesting movie. ->","completion":" I feel like that could have been interesting. Because like her acting of Harley Quinn was iconic.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think memorable. ->","completion":" But I wish that, I don't know,\n"}
{"prompt":"I wish that they built on that side of the world a little bit. ->","completion":" Hmm. I'm not talking about like the actor,\n"}
{"prompt":"but like I want to know more about like the character-wise Harley Quinn and Joker side of things. ->","completion":" Yeah. Like the characters themselves,\n"}
{"prompt":"like from the cartoons, ->","completion":" they're interesting characters. And if they built on to that,\n"}
{"prompt":"because I don't know, ->","completion":" I really liked her version of Harley Quinn. So,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah. ->","completion":" Haha. This is my favorite Batman villain.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" I mean, it has to be,\n"}
{"prompt":"well, ->","completion":" I'm more familiar with the movie side of things, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"Probably, ->","completion":" um... Ah...\n"}
{"prompt":"That's it. ->","completion":" Heath Ledger's Joker is definitely my favorite. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"that's just one villain that I just cannot forget. ->","completion":" Haha. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like if I were to imagine Joker as a character, ->","completion":" as like a real life, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"actor, ->","completion":" like that was it. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" That's why like, I feel like that set kind of a high bar,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" So, I wasn't too sure about the newest Batman movie.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" I think I still enjoyed it to an extent. But it's just like...\n"}
{"prompt":"Expectations. ->","completion":" They're a little too high on the Batman side. It was okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"but like, ->","completion":" I just... There's just such a high bar.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" The one with the new Batman, Robert Pattinson,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's his name? ->","completion":" Hmm. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I know this Batman just was too high of a standard bar. ->","completion":" Yeah. I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"it was still good though. ->","completion":" And it's alright. But really have me wondering,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" Like, hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe it was... ->","completion":" It is different from the Batman I was used to because I watched a lot. I watched,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's it? ->","completion":" The Christopher Nolan's Batman a lot. I watched it multiple times,\n"}
{"prompt":"like, ->","completion":" most of the movies. It's like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I think the reason the recent one was a little different was because of the villain they chose. ->","completion":" But it was more like, not like an action-filled villain,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know? ->","completion":" It's like more of a... Hmm,\n"}
{"prompt":"should I say? ->","completion":" More like a mystery, detecting,\n"}
{"prompt":"guessing, ->","completion":" figuring out. And that's because it was the...\n"}
{"prompt":"It was the Riddler. ->","completion":" So it couldn't have been, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"like... ->","completion":" It couldn't have been like an action-filled, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":"Battles and whatnot. ->","completion":" It's just meant to be the theme of like a detective-ish. Which is a different one than just,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" just punching, fighting all the way.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" I'm not too well-versed in like the comic book side of things, so yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"But Batman, ->","completion":" like, that's why it's an interesting character in a way because when,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" the whole universe is filled with, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"superpowers and whatnot. ->","completion":" It's Batman. And it has some pretty interesting villains,\n"}
{"prompt":"too. ->","completion":" What was that one villain in one of the Christopher Nolan ones? The one with the mask?\n"}
{"prompt":"Bane? ->","completion":" That's also very memorable, acting,\n"}
{"prompt":"too. ->","completion":" Like, if you think about it,\n"}
{"prompt":"those movies with their villains, ->","completion":" it's very memorable. I think that's what's really important for these characters is like...\n"}
{"prompt":"They gotta really be memorable. ->","completion":" Never scare... is Scarecrow the one with the bag over his head?\n"}
{"prompt":"It has the scary... ->","completion":" Yeah, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah, ->","completion":" yeah. Insanity one,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah. ->","completion":" But then like, if you think about Bane,\n"}
{"prompt":"for example, ->","completion":" like, you just hear the voice already.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" you don't even have to hear it, actually.\n"}
{"prompt":"You just hear it played out in your head. ->","completion":" You know what they look like. Scarecrow,\n"}
{"prompt":"too, ->","completion":" though, I think in the movie,\n"}
{"prompt":"is memorable because you just remember the paper bag and then you remember the scene where there's like the gas and then they have like the scary face appearing on the mask and whatnot. ->","completion":" That was very well done. That was kinda scary because I watched him in those little...\n"}
{"prompt":"not paper bags, ->","completion":" it's like the little sack thing. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Man. ->","completion":" Are you guys looking forward to Ant-Man movie? It's coming out soon,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" Like, February 15,\n"}
{"prompt":"16, ->","completion":" something around there? Wonder if I can go see it here.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm kind of half-half. ->","completion":" I'm like... I wanna see where they wanna take the next phase of Marvel.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm kind of looking forward to see what they have in store, ->","completion":" but at the same time, recently,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's been a little... ->","completion":" little worrying. On Marvel's side of things.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'll see where they're taking it from here. ->","completion":" This is just my personal opinion on it. It's just like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I feel like some things... ->","completion":" some of the movies coming out now, it's hard to keep track if you don't keep up with the...\n"}
{"prompt":"what the... ->","completion":" The Disney Plus series too. Like some of the characters or like story,\n"}
{"prompt":"you would need a recap or like a... ->","completion":" like you have to study on what happened in between the movies or shows. Just know who that character is and what their place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" I think that's what I felt with Doctor Strange 2. Because like that's why...\n"}
{"prompt":"like some people who didn't watch, ->","completion":" what's it, WandaVision,\n"}
{"prompt":"like they wanna understand why she's at that, ->","completion":" you know, position right now.\n"}
{"prompt":"I was really reliant on WandaVision. ->","completion":" Like all of a sudden, like the last time we would have seen her if she didn't watch it was probably the end game,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" And you'll be like, wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"why... ->","completion":" why she... why she doing that?\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" that's why I had to... because like I went to watch it with Monies and Papani's but they...\n"}
{"prompt":"I had to explain to them like what happened. ->","completion":" Cause they didn't watch WandaVision yet. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I did really enjoy Moonlight though. ->","completion":" Because it... and the reason behind that is because it was standalone.\n"}
{"prompt":"And you did not need previous Marvel movie watching experience to enjoy it. ->","completion":" Moonlight was pretty decent, I liked it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like sure they might add Moonlight as a character like down the line. ->","completion":" But like as a standalone series, I think it was good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" it was like the right amount of, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"conflict, ->","completion":" questions, whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt":"I didn't watch She-Hulk though. ->","completion":" I heard things about it but I didn't get to watch it yet. I don't know,\n"}
{"prompt":"I like at the same time, ->","completion":" like I like as a person, as a person,\n"}
{"prompt":"I like darker, ->","completion":" more serious series, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"With a lot of drama and conflict, ->","completion":" dark character, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"kind of going through all this emotions and struggles. ->","completion":" Like those are the kind of series that like, so more of a lighter series unless you know it's something I just watch once.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like Deadpool movie, ->","completion":" Deadpool movie is good. Like as a series,\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't think I'll be able to keep being interested in it for a long time. ->","completion":" Yeah, like that's why I really like Moonlight too because it's like the struggle he has with all these like multiple personalities.\n"}
{"prompt":"And like trying to figure out what's been going on. ->","completion":" And like facing his, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"past struggles and current struggles. ->","completion":" Yeah, did you,\n"}
{"prompt":"devil? ->","completion":" I should, I haven't watched like the pre Disney plus era of Marvel series.\n"}
{"prompt":"Mama N' Stid, ->","completion":" Mama N' Slopesome. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I've heard all about them from Mama N' Slopesome. ->","completion":" She loves watching like action series and stuff. She loves like fantasy stuff.\n"}
{"prompt":"Do you guys know the show? ->","completion":" What's it? Merlin.\n"}
{"prompt":"She loves like fantasy magic and like this like superhero. ->","completion":" She loves Merlin, the show.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think it's the BBC series. ->","completion":" Yeah, yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then, ->","completion":" and then cause due to my background in a certain God-checking, I'm familiar with the rights of the realm.\n"}
{"prompt":"And I don't know how like close to the actual story of nice of the round of the Merlin show follows. ->","completion":" But I saw like certain characters, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"What certain names, ->","completion":" what certain stories. I was just like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I know what happens next mom. ->","completion":" I know what that character is going to do. I could even like explain and like tell her about like the characters names and stuff.\n"}
{"prompt":"That was great. ->","completion":" That was some fun times. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"But like she's not familiar with like the Knights of the Round story, ->","completion":" like the origin story of the story. So yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"No, ->","completion":" I mean, I read through like the not only like faith side of the story,\n"}
{"prompt":"like I actually looked into the actual characters they're based on and their story, ->","completion":" Arturian legend stuff. Like that's what I like to do sometimes.\n"}
{"prompt":"I just like to read about like mythology and like the story things are based on. ->","completion":" Mama needs to love fate. I don't think so.\n"}
{"prompt":"She's like it's too complicated. ->","completion":" She wants something simple to the point like right there. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Fate story is not simple. She'll get confused.\n"}

{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" Which was like very rare occasion. So I wanna enjoy English.\n"}
{"prompt":"Any thoughts on the new track? ->","completion":" I've actually been watching it. I caught up.\n"}
{"prompt":"I caught up and I gotta say they have different points to enjoy compared to the original days. ->","completion":" And I hope that people enjoy it that way rather than saying, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"one's better than the other. ->","completion":" Like that's really good 3D animation. Orange is doing really good job on the 3D side.\n"}
{"prompt":"I was really impressed with all the expressions and like the body language of all the characters. ->","completion":" Yeah. It's like a different flavor,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know? ->","completion":" Yeah. They're the same ones who did Hosekinakuni,\n"}
{"prompt":"the land of the illustrious, ->","completion":" that's the English title. They also did the,\n"}
{"prompt":"what's that series? ->","completion":" Oh my goodness, my brain is actually not working.\n"}
{"prompt":"The one, ->","completion":" Beastars. Yes,\n"}

{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" They like really stepped it up in the Python 2. So,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah. ->","completion":" Is it the ending too? Opening,\n"}
{"prompt":"ending? ->","completion":" I just remember Kaibutsu. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Yeah. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" So, I really enjoy like oranges,\n"}
{"prompt":"like 3D anime. ->","completion":" Like, I feel like that's like a good direction for,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" 3D anime to go in. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I haven't watched the Slam Dunk movie. ->","completion":" Although I don't, I don't think I remember what I did in the movie.\n"}

{"prompt":"But it also has, ->","completion":" was done in 3D but has a more, what's it,\n"}
{"prompt":"realistic feel to it. ->","completion":" Yeah. It was a stylistic choice for the Slam Dunk movie.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's in the theaters in Japan right now. ->","completion":" So, probably a couple months for it to hit the,\n"}
{"prompt":"um, ->","completion":" like American, other countries.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Yeah, I saw some clips about the Lupin movie.\n"}
{"prompt":"That's also 3D right? ->","completion":" That was also really done really. I think it showed as like a preview or something on one of the movies I went to watch here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" But yeah, try the Stampede.\n"}
{"prompt":"Honestly, ->","completion":" even if you haven't watched the original, I think it's enjoyable on its own.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like, ->","completion":" I know the piecing and stuff might be different from the original, but it's like a more modern twist to it,\n"}
{"prompt":"I think. ->","completion":" So, it's nice.\n"}
{"prompt":"I like it. ->","completion":" Yeah, if you read like the comment section,\n"}
{"prompt":"they were like, ->","completion":" you know, why are people saying that,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" it's like so different from the original? They're like,\n"}
{"prompt":"they're both good. ->","completion":" Just give it a try, you know?\n"}
{"prompt":"Think of it as two different series. ->","completion":" It's not like, uh,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" second exact second, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"remade into the, ->","completion":" you know, new series,\n"}
{"prompt":"like a old series there. ->","completion":" They still have the same concepts. They just,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" changed the way they tell the story a little bit to fit, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"how storytelling is done in more modern-ish enemies. ->","completion":" It's my opinion. If you like the characters,\n"}

{"prompt":"And there's like a more modern twist to the, ->","completion":" you know, for the more modern fans.\n"}
{"prompt":"That's the thing, ->","completion":" right? That's the thing I talked about.\n"}
{"prompt":"When you want people to enjoy a series as a whole, ->","completion":" like, don't be like,\n"}
{"prompt":"oh, ->","completion":" the original was so much better, the new one was so much better,\n"}
{"prompt":"something like that. ->","completion":" Just get them interested a little bit with whatever they started off with. So if they started watching the new series,\n"}
{"prompt":"just let them watch, ->","completion":" let them enjoy it. But like,\n"}
{"prompt":"oh yeah, ->","completion":" did you enjoy that? Did you like the character?\n"}
{"prompt":"Did you like the concept? ->","completion":" Well, well,\n"}
{"prompt":"well, ->","completion":" well, I got more for you.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then you lead them to watch the original, ->","completion":" you know? And then you're like,\n"}
{"prompt":"whoa, ->","completion":" whoa, whoa,\n"}
{"prompt":"did you enjoy that? ->","completion":" Actually, actually.\n"}
{"prompt":"The original anime or what is the O.A.V. ->","completion":" and whichever. I think one of them was made before like the manga ended,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" At least that's what I researched a little bit. So like,\n"}
{"prompt":"they'll be like, ->","completion":" oh, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"there's an O.A.V. ->","completion":" series behind it. You know,\n"}
{"prompt":"you can dive deeper into the series that you have learned to enjoy. ->","completion":" So you can lead them in the way of enjoying something with different flavors. Instead of,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" cutting them off, be like,\n"}
{"prompt":"ah, ->","completion":" this is better than that, etc.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" like, like the recent episode.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think that was the most recent episode. ->","completion":" Yeah, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"like the action. ->","completion":" How so cool. That wasn't in the original.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like that's like the modern twist, ->","completion":" right? Like,\n"}

{"prompt":"There's a little twist that you can, ->","completion":" you can, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"enjoy. ->","completion":" Oh, yes,\n"}
{"prompt":"yes. ->","completion":" So, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"just keep, ->","completion":" I don't know. Just keep a...\n"}
{"prompt":"No. ->","completion":" Wide perspective on things to enjoy. What anime is he talking about?\n"}
{"prompt":"Tricon! ->","completion":" Original and the new reboot remake? Tricon.\n"}
{"prompt":"Stampede. ->","completion":" That's weird watching. Oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah, ->","completion":" I caught up on Nier as well. Like,\n"}
{"prompt":"so far, ->","completion":" so far. They look beautiful.\n"}
{"prompt":"I mean, ->","completion":" it's by a lot A1 who's animating it. So quality,\n"}
{"prompt":"pretty, ->","completion":" pretty guaranteed. Pretty good so far,\n"}
{"prompt":"definitely. ->","completion":" I mean, it's not,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's just nice hearing the music from the game and the anime. ->","completion":" It's just nice. But they said that they were adding a twist to it.\n"}
{"prompt":"A little different from the game story. ->","completion":" So I'm looking forward to seeing where they're going to take the story. You can never be sure what Yoko Taro involved,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know? ->","completion":" We're going to get tricked somehow. You can never comprehend Yoko Taro.\n"}
{"prompt":"You don't know what kind of twist we're going to have. ->","completion":" So I'm looking forward to it. Also,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" opening by Emma. Excellent.\n"}
{"prompt":"So that's one thing I'm looking forward to too. ->","completion":" And they always deliver. Anime staff had to stop him from changing too many things.\n"}

{"prompt":"Let him change things. ->","completion":" Make it good. Let him cook.\n"}
{"prompt":"Let him cook the sardine macaron. ->","completion":" Let him cook the sardine macaron. Who have a new A bracket M bracket.\n"}

{"prompt":"they're already cooked relatively healthy foods available on demand for much cheap. ->","completion":" To taking care of food scraps and garbage and pain. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like the difference I see when I open the Uber at Uber, ->","completion":" Uber eats app here. It's like so much variety.\n"}
{"prompt":"And yeah. ->","completion":" And the garbage sorting in Japan is like, I'm scared.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm going to be publicly shamed. ->","completion":" They're going to mark my garbage but like, please sort this garbage again.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm not going to meet our expectations. ->","completion":" I'm just like, I'm sorry.\n"}
{"prompt":"The pressure. ->","completion":" Yeah. I've heard stories.\n"}
{"prompt":"I've heard many stories. ->","completion":" That's why I'm like studying the garbage sorting spreadsheet. I'm just like,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay. ->","completion":" This one with the plastic mark goes in this bag. And this one with the paper mark goes in this bag.\n"}
{"prompt":"The thing is right. ->","completion":" Different regions of like even the same city has different rules. Like some people like some places they don't really care to sort like plastic into paper.\n"}
{"prompt":"Well, ->","completion":" they just sort it into like combustible and incompostible and like bottles. But some places you got to split it in even further like paper here.\n"}
{"prompt":"You know, ->","completion":" plastic here, non-burnable or recyclable plastic there.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" It's different. It's different.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh yeah. ->","completion":" I guess I guess all we announced it too. I'm going to be joining her Apex tournament games.\n"}
{"prompt":"Many games games. ->","completion":" Yeah. Is it a tournament?\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't know. ->","completion":" I'll be in the first day I think. Well,\n"}
{"prompt":"without the whole life girls. ->","completion":" Yeah. I wasn't sure if I could participate.\n"}
{"prompt":"Actually, ->","completion":" I didn't sign up to like really really late because what's it? Because I knew I was going to be here and I wasn't sure if I would have anything like scheduled on the day.\n"}
{"prompt":"But turns out, ->","completion":" they needed like one or two more people. I was like,\n"}
{"prompt":"I'll try. ->","completion":" Why did you choose Apex? I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"I haven't played in a while. ->","completion":" It's not going to be like serious games. It's just going to be fun mini games we did together.\n"}
{"prompt":"So it's not about the winning. ->","completion":" It's about having fun. So me,\n"}
{"prompt":"my goal is to just have fun that day. ->","completion":" Yeah. Life's a practice Apex games too.\n"}
{"prompt":"But it's a mini games one. ->","completion":" Anyone can play. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"All he has been playing this for so long actually. ->","completion":" I think she like wanted to set up an actual serious game tournament first. But then like there's a lot of members who don't play a lot of FPS too.\n"}
{"prompt":"So having just like mini games and stuff would be very fun. ->","completion":" So there's a lot of beginner including myself. So yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"What character did I play? ->","completion":" I've only played like one character the most in its pathfinder. I don't know if pathfinder is any good these days.\n"}
{"prompt":"But I still like playing pathfinder. ->","completion":" Pathfinder is cute. Yeah.\n"}

{"prompt":"I didn't read it yet. ->","completion":" Do I have the game downloaded? I do not.\n"}
{"prompt":"I should. ->","completion":" But yeah. There's been so many new characters since I like last played.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Is that why you're only Warlock and Destiny? Exactly.\n"}
{"prompt":"And it's not like I changed my what's it the subclass. ->","completion":" I've always, I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay. ->","completion":" I'd switch between two. But usually,\n"}
{"prompt":"usually one subclass too. ->","completion":" Okay. Overwatch is an exception.\n"}
{"prompt":"For the collab, ->","completion":" I changed characters. But yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Well, ->","completion":" when I first started playing Destiny 2, right,\n"}
{"prompt":"I played the purple one. ->","completion":" Shadow, whatchamacallit.\n"}
{"prompt":"You can eat your grenade to kill yourself one. ->","completion":" You can send out a giant ball of shadow and goes boop. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Voin. ->","completion":" Yeah. That's what I played when I first started.\n"}
{"prompt":"It was nice during PvP. ->","completion":" Kind of. Because I would just be like,\n"}
{"prompt":"Hello, ->","completion":" please take my giant purple black ball. And please die.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" I'd like, I'd like expect people to walk around the corner and I'd be like hiding in the other corner.\n"}
{"prompt":"I'd be like, ->","completion":" Yo, I'm gonna die.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" But then like during, during raids,\n"}
{"prompt":"the friends were like, ->","completion":" Inna, you're Warlock.\n"}
{"prompt":"This is one, ->","completion":" you know, subclass you might want to,\n"}
{"prompt":"maybe perhaps consider going for us. ->","completion":" Yeah. I went,\n"}
{"prompt":"I went back for the raids. ->","completion":" Yeah. Please consider quote unquote.\n"}
{"prompt":"It was fun though. ->","completion":" It was, it was pretty fun.\n"}
{"prompt":"But then we did, ->","completion":" we did kind of wipe a lot because I forgot to hit the right button at the right time. What's raids did I do?\n"}
{"prompt":"I mean, ->","completion":" I started when Destiny 2 launched on PC. So the first raid there was what,\n"}
{"prompt":"the fighting? ->","completion":" The one with like the little relay you have to do. And like,\n"}
{"prompt":"man, ->","completion":" that relay was just, that relay was just a learning curve for me.\n"}
{"prompt":"I got it. ->","completion":" Because, because Destiny 2 raids,\n"}
{"prompt":"they have like a challenge for each of the, ->","completion":" the stages, stages,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" So in order to get the challenge done for the Gauntlet, you have to have everyone do different tasks and whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt":"And the Gauntlet one, ->","completion":" I think everyone had to run the Gauntlet at least once. And you have to communicate like,\n"}
{"prompt":"which, ->","completion":" I think you have to like kill a mob and it gives you like an orb or something. And then like,\n"}
{"prompt":"you have to choose which one to like, ->","completion":" which symbol to hit. And then the people running the Gauntlet has to run through like the safe holes.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then the holes with like a timer extender. ->","completion":" Otherwise the thing you're holding like blows up. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"The thing is though, ->","completion":" the thing is though, Warlock jumps.\n"}
{"prompt":"Warlock jumps. ->","completion":" Warlocks have these very slippery shoes. And later,\n"}
{"prompt":"later in the, ->","completion":" later in the stages when you're running, there are holes on the ground that you may fall and die and fail the running.\n"}
{"prompt":"And sometimes you have to jump really high. ->","completion":" Sometimes you have to go to the middle row. Sometimes you can just slide through the bottom row and yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"floaty jumps, ->","completion":" floor slippery. Many,\n"}
{"prompt":"many deads. ->","completion":" I think the first time I had to run through like, we spent like three hours just on that stage of the raid.\n"}
{"prompt":"It was painful. ->","completion":" Yeah. But then you kind of get used to it down the line with more practice.\n"}
{"prompt":"But then in between like the big, ->","completion":" you know, the big battles,\n"}
{"prompt":"they have these like secret passageways where you can get the keys to get more boxes and whatnot. ->","completion":" And there's many that require some platforming and yeah. Oh,\n"}
{"prompt":"the underbelly. ->","completion":" Yeah. I heard a lot of things changed though.\n"}
{"prompt":"So it's not like the, ->","completion":" it's not like the old days. I missed the days.\n"}
{"prompt":"It was kind of fun. ->","completion":" Especially the last, what's it?\n"}
{"prompt":"The last fight, ->","completion":" right? Where people get zoomed into the other,\n"}
{"prompt":"other realm where you get sucked in. ->","completion":" Except you have to like find like a ledge that you can like park yourself in. And you got to shoot down all the skulls.\n"}
{"prompt":"Otherwise they're going to bop you and you're going to get sucked into the black hole. ->","completion":" Yeah. The shadow realm.\n"}
{"prompt":"That was pretty fun. ->","completion":" It's funny when like you miss killing because there's like, there's like these random mobs that pop up and they shoot like these like attacks at you and like bops you out of your safe spot.\n"}
{"prompt":"And when someone, ->","completion":" someone gets that, you can just feel like they're blasting off again.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then they just, ->","completion":" they just die. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"And if you like don't, ->","completion":" what's it? If you don't park yourself right when you get first like sucked in,\n"}
{"prompt":"then there's like holes in the ground and you just fall and die. ->","completion":" Yeah. That was,\n"}
{"prompt":"that was pretty fun. ->","completion":" What other raid did I do? There was the one with like the,\n"}
{"prompt":"um, ->","completion":" It was like the hot potato. That was the end of the raid.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" But like before that, there was like the whole bunch of symbols.\n"}
{"prompt":"And there's like a whole bunch of rooms. ->","completion":" Was it last wish? It's the one where you shoot down a whole bunch of eyes.\n"}
{"prompt":"Riven. ->","completion":" Yeah, Riven.\n"}
{"prompt":"That was the name. ->","completion":" And at the very end you have to like play hot potato with everyone, right?\n"}
{"prompt":"When you run out to like dunk the little orb thing at the end, ->","completion":" people, people have like timers and they get sent to this weird realm.\n"}
{"prompt":"You gotta run around more platforms. ->","completion":" Yeah. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"What other raids were, ->","completion":" I feel like that's the only one I remember. Did I do another one?\n"}
{"prompt":"Those are the two that I remember. ->","completion":" Wait, wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"no, ->","completion":" I think there was that one. Was it the same one?\n"}
{"prompt":"There was like this one with like a pretty big room. ->","completion":" And you have to like go into like the little holes in the wall whenever there's like a giant like flash. You have to like hide from it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Was that the same raid? ->","completion":" It might have been different one. Is that still last wish?\n"}
{"prompt":"Okay. ->","completion":" Yeah, I think that was the one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Those are the two that I haven't played in a really long time. ->","completion":" Third of the past. It sounds familiar.\n"}
{"prompt":"What are the mechanics in that one? ->","completion":" I remember it by the mechanic. I don't remember the names of the place.\n"}
{"prompt":"The giant slide. ->","completion":" Giant mecha at the end. Oh.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" yeah, I think I have done that one.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like the giant. ->","completion":" What should I call it? Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"it kind of looks like some kind of like sci-fi arena thing, ->","completion":" right? And then there's like a...\n"}
{"prompt":"Is that one part of it? ->","completion":" Oh, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"there's this like one town thing. ->","completion":" And there's like a big machine in the middle of the town. You got like kind of like bike around the place and like,\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" and the spark. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I remember that giant sun chasing you down like down the pathway. ->","completion":" You got to hit all the right buttons to get the secret or extra chest or whatever. Yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"I remember that now. ->","completion":" I think I made it to the end of the race part alive like once or twice. That was scary.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like a giant sun chasing after you. ->","completion":" You're just like, well,\n"}
{"prompt":"guess I'll die. ->","completion":" Yeah. Well,\n"}
{"prompt":"it's cause like the right is very slippery, ->","completion":" you know? Kind of get stuck in the corners and slow down.\n"}
{"prompt":"You plan to watch the new Transformers movie? ->","completion":" I kind of want to fence with this one because there's only like two ways a Transformers movie can go. But Mamani's wants to watch it,\n"}
{"prompt":"so maybe. ->","completion":" Mamani's loves action movies, Transformers.\n"}
{"prompt":"You know, ->","completion":" if she wants to watch, then I got a book to take it.\n"}
{"prompt":"Garden of salvation, ->","completion":" that sounds familiar. What's the mechanics with that one?\n"}
{"prompt":"It sounds familiar. ->","completion":" The tethers. Gambit,\n"}
{"prompt":"chicken master. ->","completion":" I'm not sure. I'm not the one to pick up the most.\n"}
{"prompt":"Wait, ->","completion":" maybe I should just google it. I should just google what it looks like.\n"}
{"prompt":"Garden of salvation. ->","completion":" Garden of salvation. Wait,\n"}
{"prompt":"where do I see like the... ->","completion":" The maps? Not blue table,\n"}
{"prompt":"I just want to see the red. ->","completion":" Wait, this looks familiar.\n"}
{"prompt":"Kind of. ->","completion":" Is that the one with all the... The...\n"}
{"prompt":"what's it? ->","completion":" There's like a thing you have to do in the first battle. It looks kind of like a temple.\n"}
{"prompt":"Is that the one? ->","completion":" Maybe not. Maybe not.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's Vault of Glass. ->","completion":" I guess that's the other thing I did. I did that one.\n"}
{"prompt":"I did that one. ->","completion":" I was like the one where you have to shoot the... thingamajig.\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe I should look up a guide. ->","completion":" Maybe that'll show me. I did up south ancient mankind.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh. ->","completion":" Hahaha. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" Shadow Keep. Entering back to the Black Garden to take down an ancient evil.\n"}
{"prompt":"Okay, ->","completion":" okay. Hmm.\n"}
{"prompt":"Hmm. ->","completion":" Okay, the mechanics look familiar,\n"}
{"prompt":"but I don't think I've done it. ->","completion":" How did I? Why does the mechanics look familiar then?\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no idea. ->","completion":" Maybe I was watching streams back then. I don't remember running it myself though.\n"}
{"prompt":"Unless I'm mistaken. ->","completion":" Like what I remember is like the giant field. Like I remember the giant field,\n"}
{"prompt":"the giant robot at the end. ->","completion":" The giant robot. And then like how you're not supposed to touch the floor or whatnot.\n"}
{"prompt":"I remember blowing myself up at the greening lunch. ->","completion":" But then I blew myself up at the greening lunch a lot of times. That's not uncommon.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" I don't know if that was there or during the story or whatever. So yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't remember. ->","completion":" The boss one is the floor that disappeared. I do remember the floor disappearing though in one of the fights,\n"}
{"prompt":"but I don't know if that was the... ->","completion":" Did I run it? It's like the one where like the floor disappears and there's like a giant arena thing at the bottom,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" And they have, they still have the sci-fi pillars.\n"}
{"prompt":"Is that the front thing? ->","completion":" Maybe it's a stri- Oh, that's the strike.\n"}
{"prompt":"Right. ->","completion":" That's not the rate. It's the strike.\n"}
{"prompt":"One of the strikes. ->","completion":" Yeah, yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah. ->","completion":" Okay, okay,\n"}
{"prompt":"okay. ->","completion":" Okay, so I'm remembering the strike then.\n"}
{"prompt":"Where I blew myself up at the greening lunch. ->","completion":" I mean, I've done that many times,\n"}
{"prompt":"so I'm not surprised that the memories are all mixed together. ->","completion":" You know which strike I really disliked? The one in kind of like the cave area?\n"}
{"prompt":"The one in kind of like the cave area? ->","completion":" Where like the boss shoots at you from like across the room, hanging from like the ceiling or whatever.\n"}
{"prompt":"It's like a whole bunch of snow and mud just crawling on you. ->","completion":" I really didn't like that strike. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Or like if you don't kill the mobs fast enough, ->","completion":" you're just gonna get swarmed. I think that's what it's called.\n"}
{"prompt":"That's the one where you go like down that lab looking place. ->","completion":" We lost contact with so and so and so. We go down like deep deep deep in and realize like they took over the entire place and got to get rid of all the mobs and kill the boss.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Yeah. That was not a fun one.\n"}
{"prompt":"Purple crystals, ->","completion":" you gotta shoot them down. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Would I play the New York expansions on stream? ->","completion":" Probably not. I say I quote unquote played but I wasn't that good.\n"}
{"prompt":"Did you ever check out the VR map? ->","completion":" Not yet. That's the thing,\n"}
{"prompt":"right? ->","completion":" I'm not sure if I want to keep it until I have the VR equipment again and actually walk around it or just do like a desktop stream. I'm kind of leaning towards having it in the VR.\n"}
{"prompt":"Set up again. ->","completion":" It'll be more what I say. Close closer experience to appreciate the VR world.\n"}
{"prompt":"Immersive, ->","completion":" that's the word. I love English.\n"}
{"prompt":"Sugar running out of brain. ->","completion":" Did you try getting back when my phone watches? Probably not.\n"}
{"prompt":"I have no time. ->","completion":" I have no time. Maybe I'll just watch some streamers play it or not.\n"}
{"prompt":"But yeah. ->","completion":" Streaming time. Time always something I don't have enough of.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah. ->","completion":" Busy, busy,\n"}
{"prompt":"busy. ->","completion":" At least till like... Actually this stream is pretty busy.\n"}
{"prompt":"Oh, ->","completion":" I did see that they're gonna add... What's that?\n"}
{"prompt":"Fulcana? ->","completion":" What's the name? From world to rise?\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm curious. ->","completion":" Where are they gonna add? Maybe traveling to Japan a lot this year?\n"}
{"prompt":"I feel like if there's a chance to, ->","completion":" right? I would like to.\n"}
{"prompt":"What I realized when I was here is the fact that... ->","completion":" It's the fact that being here physically makes a lot of things very easy. Like for example,\n"}
{"prompt":"when we're given something to choose for example, ->","completion":" by Jammah, she has to translate it to us.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then due to the time difference, ->","completion":" the time zone difference, we see it much later.\n"}
{"prompt":"And then we sometimes have something going on when checking the messages and we sometimes forget to answer. ->","completion":" And then there's a lot of time between all these small decisions stuff. But being here physically or at least in the same time zone ish.\n"}
{"prompt":"It really makes it easier to confirm or last minute change a whole bunch of stuff. ->","completion":" We have easier access to the studio and other resources they have. So yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"if there are stuff to be done, ->","completion":" then it would be really easy to be here in person. Plus no more early morning meetings and stuff.\n"}
{"prompt":"It would be nice to have a semi permanent base here too. ->","completion":" That way I don't have to look for solid internet connection every time or have set up stream with borrowed equipment every single time. I'll just have to see how much it is and what the viability is.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" this is ruined Callie. That'd be nice but I wouldn't want to intrude all the time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Callie, ->","completion":" I'm moving in! Maybe she wouldn't mind,\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't know. ->","completion":" The thing is stream schedule is going to be hectic and may... Depends,\n"}
{"prompt":"depends. ->","completion":" I might go on a short vacation after my birthday with family. But before then,\n"}
{"prompt":"I'll still be streaming pretty normally. ->","completion":" May, may be busy.\n"}
{"prompt":"April, ->","completion":" as I said before, I might have to go...\n"}
{"prompt":"I just want family. ->","completion":" Depends, I'll have to double check their schedule too.\n"}
{"prompt":"I think it's going to be like a... ->","completion":" Maybe like a week in April. Maybe a couple of days in May after birthday though.\n"}
{"prompt":"But yeah, ->","completion":" birthday is going to be normal. But I'm going to be traveling a lot this year definitely.\n"}
{"prompt":"Not that more borders are open. ->","completion":" Visit ahead of time or plan things ahead of time. But yeah,\n"}
{"prompt":"it is something I'm going to definitely consider seriously. ->","completion":" Having maybe like a more permanent place I can call a base here. I'll have to look into what the...\n"}
{"prompt":"Viabilities are for having... ->","completion":" A place or renting a place or whatnot. Well,\n"}
{"prompt":"I'm just like... ->","completion":" If I'm just traveling or if I have to get... A longer work visa or something.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because there's like short term and long term. ->","completion":" In terms of work visas. And there's like the tourist visas.\n"}
{"prompt":"And there's like some other all kinds of visas. ->","completion":" So yeah, I'll have to definitely look into that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because sometimes like... ->","completion":" What's it? Sometimes some apartments don't allow certain people with like short term visas or tourist visas or something like that.\n"}
{"prompt":"Like buy or rent apartments and stuff. ->","completion":" It's something that I'll have to discuss with. Not only like...\n"}
{"prompt":"Not only just looking and researching, ->","completion":" I could probably ask staff too about... Because they'll probably know more things about more permanent stuff here.\n"}
{"prompt":"Okay, ->","completion":" I'm sure they probably know like pretty good... Real estate companies or people,\n"}
{"prompt":"they have connections for that. ->","completion":" So yeah, that stuff definitely will help out.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because it'll make things a lot easier for them too. ->","completion":" Rather than trying to organize things like overseas. So if I'm here,\n"}
{"prompt":"you know, ->","completion":" they have me ready to do whatever, whenever.\n"}
{"prompt":"So something I would consider. ->","completion":" I'll also have to discuss with the you know, my wife and papa.\n"}
{"prompt":"Because if I'm overseas for a long period of time, ->","completion":" they're the one who's gonna have to, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"be doing the taking care of the office one way. ->","completion":" So yeah, when am I drawing up about that?\n"}
{"prompt":"We kind of... ->","completion":" yeah. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Maybe some other time. ->","completion":" But I definitely want to finish this, you know,\n"}
{"prompt":"before the end of... ->","completion":" Actually end of this week? Or at least like early,\n"}
{"prompt":"early in the week next week. ->","completion":" So I might just record the process and maybe I'll upload some kind of time lapse thing before FES. So you guys can look forward to it.\n"}
{"prompt":"But yeah. ->","completion":" I'm gonna keep this in the drawing stream playlist. I mean,\n"}
{"prompt":"I technically drew a little bit, ->","completion":" okay? I drew a little,\n"}
{"prompt":"I drew like five lines. ->","completion":" I didn't give up. Well,\n"}
{"prompt":"I gave up drawing, ->","completion":" but... But yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"I don't know, ->","completion":" there's just so much to talk about and go on tangents with, like especially around here.\n"}
{"prompt":"There's gonna be a lot more just random talking streams down the line. ->","completion":" So please look forward to that. But yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" try, try,\n"}
{"prompt":"try in and doesn't give up. ->","completion":" Yes. Um,\n"}
{"prompt":"yeah. ->","completion":" It's uh... Yes,\n"}
{"prompt":"that's all I really need to talk about today. ->","completion":" I'm tackle about today. Yeah.\n"}
{"prompt":"So tomorrow is gonna be that short ish. ->","completion":" Maybe I'll go on tangents again. Who knows?\n"}
{"prompt":"Um, ->","completion":" special ish stream. Try to wake up in time.\n"}
{"prompt":"Yeah, ->","completion":" we'll do a little bit of chatting. I'll show you guys some new things.\n"}
{"prompt":"Please look forward to that. ->","completion":" I'm planning for the usual 7am JST 2pm Pacific time. But if not,\n"}
{"prompt":"I will let you guys know on Twitter just like today. ->","completion":" Yeah. Thank you so much for listening to me around today.\n"}
{"prompt":"And watching me draw like five lines. ->","completion":" Um, I mean it was kind of like a stress test for drawing streams too.\n"}
{"prompt":"So now I got it, ->","completion":" got it all figured out. Got it all figured out.\n"}
{"prompt":"So yes. ->","completion":" Thank you, thank you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Thank you. ->","completion":" I hope you guys look forward to the X-Bow illustration as well. I'm gonna try something,\n"}
{"prompt":"something fun with it. ->","completion":" So it'll be cool to see it in, in,\n"}
{"prompt":"in display. ->","completion":" Yeah. Thank you.\n"}
{"prompt":"Thank you. ->","completion":" I hope you guys have a wonderful rest of the morning afternoon evening. I'll see you guys tomorrow,\n"}
{"prompt":"tomorrow, ->","completion":" tomorrow, tomorrow.\n"}
{"prompt":"Okay. ->","completion":" Thank you. Bye bye.\n"}
{"prompt":"Bye bye. ->","completion":" Bye bye. Bye bye.\n"}
