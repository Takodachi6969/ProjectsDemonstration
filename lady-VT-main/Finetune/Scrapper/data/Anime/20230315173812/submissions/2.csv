zi13pn,1670700533,"I guess I hit that point, seeking anime recommendations","Hi everyone ! This is my MAL https://myanimelist.net/animelist/perrycotto Iâ€™m going to list the main anime for reference and to understand my preferences, the link is to have all the anime in one place.\n\n\nI absolutely loved the complexity and the mystery in Attack on Titan although the level of violence was at my limit, I also enjoyed Full Metal Alchemist for the same reason, I really enjoyed the characters development and own journey to their dreams even the drama was on point; Death Note is one of my favourite masterpieces.(Berserk would be the next choice but itâ€™s too dark for me). I highly appreciate an original story and a detailed animation, Iâ€™m aware of other old school animes but my limit is the animation style, I can watch easily Mononoke, Pro Mare, Sonny Boy, Monogatari, Ping Pong but although they are hugely suggested I canâ€™t stand the awful character design in Code Geass, Clannad, Angel Beast). Neon Genesis Evangelion was a lucid dream, fantastic.\n\nHxH is still one of my favourite if weâ€™re talking adventure, lore, world building and action, same with One Piece, Bleach, Baku no hero, and  Naruto (Iâ€™m reading  canâ€™t stand to see the anime and its fillers, in fact Iâ€™m seeing most of One Piece following One Pace stellar editing. Tensei Slime and Mushoku Tensei are my favourite of the reincarnated genre, I donâ€™t like Overloard for the character design.\n\nComedy wise Iâ€™ve watched countless times Great Teacher Onizuka (plus every possible manga from the author), Mob Psycho, Love is War, One Punch Man, I lost it watching Nichijou and its clever pun game and references (I know Gintama would be the obvious choice but it doesnâ€™t particularly attract me), Honda san (skeleton librarian anime), The way of the husband. I really enjoy the comedy plus action of Full Metal Panic and Spy x Family.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen is the max in terms of creepiness, I donâ€™t like Psycho pass and really hated Death Parade and Chainsaw man, canâ€™t stand the excessive gore, violence and excessive psychological absurdity. Iâ€™m well comfortable and enjoy greatly Steinâ€™s Gate.\n\nI love the style of studio Bones, Madhouse and Ghibli.\n\nI am an avid manga reader (at the moment everything Urosawa and Akira.\n\nAsk me anything to have a better idea, sorry for my poor English, thanks everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/

Then she kills him but she ends up dying at the end. The MC then wakes up and finds all his other friends who died and the girl who just killed him, her face was dark but then brightens up and she smiles at him, much calmer than just recently. They all smile then left together. Back in the world, the lone girl who is the last to survive takes the MC's dead body then while in the sea, kisses him saying ""Boys like this kind of thing, don't they?""

I was pretty sure they could control some sort of large powerful beasts (like dragons or something), which is why the humans wanted to enslave them. Also I think the main characterâ€™s race of people have really long lifespans. She ends up finding a human baby boy and adopts him. It was really impressive because she had to move to a human city as a refugee and lives as a single mother, and the movie shows the very realistic struggle of being a single working mom (I think sheâ€™s a waitress). Her adopted son grows up fast while she stays looking the same age. Hopefully I didnâ€™t misremember too much.
