zhvq56,1670687364,Do you ever feel disillusioned with the modern audience?,"This post isn't made to be offensive but to see if there are any who feel the same way as me. \n\nDoes anyone feel like that in recent times the audience has become way too much focused on appreciating the visually exhilarating action scences and less focused on the technical bits such as direction, storyboarding, sound design, set pieces, or other similar aspects?  Or should i say the action heavy climactic episodes take up more precedence over the introspective experimental dialogue episodes where it's just characters talking.. think about something similar to Monogatari or Monster. \n\nNow it seems the more shinier and fluid animation there is the more better as a whole the actual series or movie is. I feel like there is much less focus on the experimental aspects of making of an anime.",https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zhvq56/do_you_ever_feel_disillusioned_with_the_modern/

My life depends on it atm.,My country is rapidly collapsing and I need to flee on an Aeroplane while I still can but my elderly mother has Tinnitus and the doctors have advised that it is very unsafe to go on aeroplanes due to the atmospheric pressure causing severe damage to the eardrums (he also stated that her age also contributed to the issue). Is there anyway to get around that problem? I'm very desperate,https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zhvoo4/i_need_some_serious_help_with_this_issue_my_life/
