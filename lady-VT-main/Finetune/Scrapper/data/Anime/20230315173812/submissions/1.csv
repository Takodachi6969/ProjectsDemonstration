zi76ry,1670715052,Anime Idea: Teaching Christianity in another world.,"Main character is a kind young Christian training to be a priest when he is murdered by a robber. Before he dies he says ‚Äúlord please forgive him and myself for our sins‚Äù rather than curse the murderer. God and Jesus greet him in heaven and decide to reward his kind spirit with a chance to save a world in a parallel universe that has debilitating morals. They order him to teach about god and Christianity to the people of that world and turn them over a new leaf as they worship polytheism, commit atrocities like murder rape and slavery on a regular basis and must be enlightened. The main character accepts and tries to pass on stories of Christ but has trouble do to many people not caring or not believing him as his own admission Jesus never lived on the new planet, but he is determined to see his mission through despite the dangers of the evil governments placing a bounty on him for trying to convert people. \n\nStories he tells include: Jesus birth, King Herad ordering the deaths of young boys to try and kill Jesus, Jesus death and resurrection, the prodigal son story.\n\nWhat you think?
