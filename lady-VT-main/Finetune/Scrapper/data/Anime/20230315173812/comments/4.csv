(Ergo the slap.) \n\nThere is a line between being strong and inauthentic and I think a lot of Aileen's problems was her coming across as manipulative which weren't earning Claudes trust, she didn't feel like the same character from the first arc, who was strong, but also kind to go with her cunning. It was an example of ""Good is Not Nice"" so to speak.\n\nAnyway its all happy ever after I guess, and we also know why Cedric turned out such as ass seeing as his grandmother enslaved a sorcery family just to preserve her youth he's had an example of being raised by trash women and guys that go along with trash women.\n\nI also wish he would have disowned Lilia instead of saying, I won't go along but I love you.",1670730714,t3_zhuqgq,/r/anime/comments/zhuqgq/akuyaku_reijou_nano_de_last_boss_wo/izqsf6f/

izo1kqt,zhuqgq,"Aileen wakes up in a cell and in handcuffs...which for her is old hat at this point. Like just the look on her face like she's not surprised at all because she's so used to it. Although when you've got Holy Sword Maiden powers, nothing can hold you back!  \n  \nI guess we're meant to sympathize with Elephas a little in that he was being controlled by the Dowager Empress for the sake of his family who were being held hostage at her whim, and then he became another Lilia simp (and Aileen is not about to hear yet another sappy story about someone falling in love with Lilia) which screwed him over. Aileen may never forgive him for what he did to Almond or her, but she can still use him if he begs hard enough. Although to his credit, ripping out his own eye so they can use it to save Claude is a pretty strong start to redeeming himself.  \n  \nOh, so the Dowager Empress doesn't just have anime genes. She was literally holding a bunch of sorcerers hostage just so she could continue to look young. Which set up an amazing payoff at the end when the old hag is forced to look like she really is in all her decrepit glory.   \n  \nSelena is finally on the heroes' side, even if it's just to spite Lilia. Although it seems like she does have some affection for Auguste to that can sway her. Even Aileen ships it now!  \n  \nI'm only mildly disappointed we didn't get to see Rachel hit someone over the head with that frying pan.  \n  \nWell, now Aileen also has to head off a demon invasion by saving Claude, not that she needs even more motivation. But it was also nice to see Bezelbuth bond with Aileens' subordinates. Humans are stupid, but they're kind, caring, and loving through that stupidity at times.  \n  \nIt was always going to come down to Aileen vs Lilia, and Lilia now has a Holy Sword she gained through another romance route, and they're fairly evenly matched. Lilia even tries to pull a reverse of what happened between them in the first arc by absorbing her Holy Sword back from Aileen. But Aileen has true love and the power of her Demon Lord lover backing her up that lets her overcome Lilia.   \n  \nBut the real MVP was none other than...Almond! Who Elephas put in suspended animation and was freed by Cedric! And how dishes out a surprise special move to break the door down and deliver another defeat for Lilia! That's our Almond!  \n  \nJeez, even to the bitter end they're trying to execute Aileen. But no perfect moment for Claude to make his comeback and make it clear he's in charge now, and it's time for all the guilty parties to get their just desserts. Which includes Cedric who willingly exposes himself and Lilia, finally showing some proper backbone even if he still loves Lilia in spite of everything. And Lilia is left wondering how this is all happening as her life crumbles around her. Serves her right, now she really has to deal with the reality of living in this world.  \n  \nAll's well that ends well...Claude and Aileen are reunited, Elephas' family is free (and Claude restores his eye), the Emperor and the Dowager Empress are basically getting kicked out and exiled, and Cedric and Lilia are heading off to prison together. Bonus points for having the two of them attend Aileen and Cedric's wedding while still handcuffed.  \n  \nBut the best way to cap off the ending is Aileen and Cedric finally wed, with their happy ending assured! I can't think of a better conclusion for the show than these two together, minus the fact that we never got a full kiss on the lips.

Their fight choreography was decent. I wonder why they don't just let themselves slash each other. The sword can't slice humans, and Aileen absorbed it the last time it happened, which Lilia tried today, but ultimately failed because *the power of love^(TM)* was able to UNO Reverse Card her.\n\nAnd then we got the suddenly strong and alive Almond, the conveniently shaped clock magic tool, and Claude appearing out of nowhere to save the day.

izntypl,zhtlbn,">While I'm sure quality is one factor, what are some others?\n\nThe style of anime that a studio excels in. For example, Bones may not be a better fit than Kyoto Animation if the source material being adapted is a slice of life/drama-heavy series with an emphasis on subtle character acting, but they'd be a better fit if it's very heavily reliant on 2D animated action sequences.\n\nNot that a lot of these studios *can't* do both (Bones has shown their ability to handle less action-oriented projects like ""Josee, the Tiger and the Fish"", and Kyoto Animation has proven to be able to handle action sequences very well with Beyond the Boundary, as well as snippets here and there in a lot of their other anime), but if someone heard that a KEY visual novel was getting an adaptation, for example, they'd likely be hoping Kyoto Animation would adapt it based on their track record, whereas something like a new One Punch Man season would seemingly be better off in Bones's hands.\n\nJust using those two studios as an example, since they are two of the best at what they do, but with differing strengths.\n\nEdit: Seems others have basically answered the same thing, while I was wasting my time typing this out Ó\_Ò",1670682928,t3_zhtlbn,/r/anime/comments/zhtlbn/what_are_the_differences_between_what_studio/izntypl/

This leads to them also being able to bring up newer people in their style to keep the system going, but sometimes you get a wildcard director in there or something and it can completely shake up the output.\n\nSome studios also just have more consistent animation quality and things of that nature. Some studios also have things like a better CG team. For example, Studio Orange is pretty much the best in the biz for full CG anime right now.\n\nAnother thing of note is how many projects a studio takes on at once and how many teams they have within their studio. A1 pictures is HUGE so they put out a ton of work. Kyoto Animation on the other hand, is still a sizable studio but smaller, so they only put out a handful of things a year and might not have a show every season.\n\nThere's also the matter of how well each studio treats their employees, but that's a story for another time...",1670699345,t3_zhtlbn,/r/anime/comments/zhtlbn/what_are_the_differences_between_what_studio/izowgat/

izntzzy,zhsmlc,"We wanted to see Ilvia again, but not like this. I didn't expect her to reappear as villain. However, as what my fellow reddit users have mentioned, the current Ilvia which we saw in this episode is probably another villain in disguise. Since this villain knows how Lucica and Ilvia look, perhaps it is the creature Al unknowingly released when he was young?\n\nThe antagonists in Noumin Kanren should already know by now that Al is no ordinary / average adventurer. He can run on water across seas to reach another region, which will usually take 3 days by ship. I was like ""wtf!? Lol!"" at that scene.\n\nFal-ys, Helen and Ruri are right. More female characters appear when Al goes on adventures,  especially when they are not around. In fact, even in Al's dreams now.

At least I think so.  \n\nIt did have a few unexpected twists, unfortunately every single one of them had a ""but"" attached.  \n\nThey decided to finally tone down how annoying his mother is, only to turn it into a plot point, and it wasn't actually her.  \nThey brought back the dead and buried imouto. Kind of. Still not sure what to make of this one.  \nAnd for the Megami they cast veteran Shimamoto Sumi, but only gave her like 3 broken half-lines during a fever dream.  \n\nWell, Al's never before mentioned ass-pull ability to Jesus-walk across an entire ocean did actually make me laugh, so I guess the farmer wins this week.

Much detail is offered: he is a good disputer, **gives men the understanding of the voices of birds, bullocks, dogs, and other creatures**, and of the noise of the waters too, and gives true answers concerning things to come. He is depicted in 19th and 20th century occultist illustrations as **appearing in the form of the black bird called a thrush**, but soon he changes his shape into a man that has a sharp sword in his hand. When answering questions he seems to stand on burning ashes or coals. The title ""President"" of Hell would suggest a parallel with the presiding officer of a college or convocation, which are the only pre-modern uses of the term. Camio's name seems to be taken from the biblical first murderer, Cain.\n\nCamui's bloodline ability is, of course, the power to speak to animals.

Thankfully, he totally has a plan to go for the Legendary Leaf. That was absolutely his plan from the start and definitely not something he accepted as the only way to have a chance of winning.\n\nAs team Irumget started, their training finally starts to pay off! Lied's training under Robin gave him the concentration to use his bloodline ability to jump from one demon to another all to find his target, and even Bachiko's ""training"" to both of the boys also comes in handy as her personal maids Iruminati and Lindy return to put on a show for Kerori!

Although poor Iruma is feeling guilty that he ate a lot of their ingredients, but Elizabetta probably would have taken those too.  \n  \nI think most people had it pegged that Iruma and Lead would need the Legend Leaf to win this, but to find out the truth about it they'll need the help of the creatures of the forest...and the only one who can talk to them is Camui. Time to pay a visit to Queen Keroli and her kingdom of simps and cute (and ferocious) animals!  \n  \nMan, Keroli really basking in the glow and power of being a queen with absolute authority, power, and regal beauty. Nao Toyama really nailing what it means to be an ice queen with sensual yet firm authority in her voice. She's not about to let Iruma and Lead get help without offering something in return!  \n  \nAnd of course, this being a Keroli segment, the chances of Iruma crossdressing are surprisingly high. And thus Lindy and Iruminatti make a return appearance, complete with a music video of them dancing! And it's surprisingly well-animated and cute!  \n  \nKeroli isn't just a great Dem-Doll in her own right, she's also a fan! And that means she enjoys watching performances, and it's a great stress reliever when she's about to hit her Evil Cycle. Although what would her Evil Cycle look like? Pure ice queen? Would she freeze everything around her?  \n  \nAnd then we get a sudden animal music number that was also adorable. I don't know why it had to involve a divorced housewife and a mother-in-law, but at least it gave them an idea of what they need to do for the Legend Leaf.  \n  \nKeroli probably planning their next idol performance for her personal pleasure.  \n  \nWith the teachers exhausted and more students forfeiting, it's up to the student council to pick up the slack! Which is basically just an excuse to give Ameri more screen time, not that we mind.  \n  \nOf course Ameri was hoping for an excuse to see Iruma, but their reunion will have to wait for a more appropriate time. But she still believes he can turn things around despite being dead last. And her female subordinate can totally tell she has the hots for Iruma.   \n  \nI love how Ameri seemingly just kicked herself to victory in the original Harvest Festival.   \n  \nNow I kind of feel bad for Ameri if she doesn't get a bouquet...although if she'll take it as a proposal, maybe it's better for Iruma to wait for later on that front.  \n  \nI'm not surprised Jazz and Allocer are running a betting game on the Harvest Festival so much as I'm surprised they already quit. I guess we'll see what happened in the next episode, but I suspect Furfur won't let them live it down.  \n  \nSu-ki-ma!
