Probably a combination of the art, the setting, the ""feel"" and (last but not least) the voice of the heroine.  \n\nPerhaps because Shouxue started so young as consort, it made her more prone to pick up support.  She is such a combination of steely strength and vulnerable young girl,  Not sure that I'll ever be able to pick one favorite show of this season (too many shows I love), but I think Shouxue is my clear pick for best character and Saku MIZUNO is my pick for most distinctive performance.\n\nDespite its (superficially) low-key tone, this show has been surprisingly stressful at times -- and no more so than with this cliff-hanger ending.  One has to assume poor Wen Ying is no more.  While Shouxue will assuredly not be defeated by the Owl, how much mental damage will she sustain if she wound up causing the death of a friend?\n\nWho is the Owl -- and why would he dare to try to destroy the priestess/avatar of a goddess?

Every single moment of social interaction complex turns into powerful comedies!

I swear that Ryou would have pretended that she didn't owe anything LOL, if not for *onee-chan* Seika to interfere.\n\nI really like the fact that Kikuri has become Bocchi-chan's drunk mentor, and a damn good one at that - she really did the vital job of nailing Bocchi's swaying confidence down and giving the crucial support for her to come out and perform. It's also heart-warming to see Kita-chan giving the apology at the end - Bocchi-chan needed everything to finally get her mind fixed up and this one is the final nail ~~into her socializing coffin shown earlier~~ she needed.\n\nSchool Festival.

izoo68a,zhwvlv,"Mostly a build up episode so a bit slower than others but still plenty enjoyable. I know a criticism towards the anime and its handling of Bocchi's development is the amount of outside help she receives, in this episode it was Kita the one that ended up turning the application rather than Bocchi getting over her fear. But I appreciate that Bocchi receives this as a positive, she is fully aware that she is being irrational in this fear but she deeply wants too. Its like the introductory narration in every episode of Komi-san that gets tiringg but is still true, ""just because they can't it doesn't mean they don't want to"". The illogical thinking in anxious people is a very real thing and I'm glad it at least recognized that this is something Bocchi is aware but is still outside of her control, hopefully we see her doing it stuff more independently in the future.\n\n* [Cool Bocchi](https://i.imgur.com/qZGzeBR.jpeg)\n\n* [Just identify yourself as a guy 5head](https://i.imgur.com/qLpcK7R.jpeg)\n\n* [""That bitch Hitori, imma kill her.

Then again, if Bocchi is in our universe, she can experience firsthand how popular she is.\n\nI expected Kita to turn in the school festival stage use application for Bocchi. No way she didn't see that slip of paper. I was pleasantly surprised Kita revealed the truth to Bocchi. Kita probably knew Bocchi would be indecisive, so someone has to take action instead of procrastinating.\n\nLast week, a fellow reddit user mentioned we already have a Bocchi x  Nijika and a Bocchi x Kita episode. This week, we have a mini Bocchi x Kukuri episode. I didn't expect Kukuri to be an introvert in the past too. Now she is inspiring Bocchi, notwithstanding the alcoholic behaviour. She goes into ""serious mode"" when she opens her eyes, doesn't she?\n\nI am so glad that with the help of Seika, Bocchi has gotten her money back. Is this show secretly implying bassists (Ryo and Kukuri) are always in debt? Lol! Then again, Bocchi seems like the type of person who is too timid to demand back her money in an aggressive manner.\n\nThe characters from Sickhack, as well as the manager of livehouse Folt, are surprisingly nice people, despite their appearance. If ""Bocchi the Rock"" does very well and have surplus budget in future, I am curious to see the animated version of Sickhack's performance.\n\nLastly, looking forward to the school festival live performance by Kessoku Band in the upcoming episodes!",1670692381,t3_zhwvlv,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izofh52/

Bocchi wanted to perform but she couldn't muster up enough courage to apply, so Kita gave her a little push so that Bocchi gets her longtime wish fulfilled. I really love how the band members are being great friends to Bocchi and that they're willing to help her break out of her shell. \n\nBocchi's character development is amazing too. Noticed a little parallel with the Drunk Lady after her brief backstory reveal. Bocchi started out as a gloomy loner in Ep1 and now she's made some great friends, playing in a band, and got big ambitions of being a big rock star. And she's doing it without alcohol! Maybe her fantasies of being famous can actually happen!\n\nAnd, uh that cliffhanger. Guess the stress and pressure of performing in the festival caught up to her.

I wish I had them back then.  \nAnd yes. [Nijika's cold stare](https://imgur.com/WISc5mK). I don't want to sound creepy but, let me be honest. This part of Nijika is also good. And also [Nijika pulling Bocchi](https://imgur.com/mFKtFnh) to stop her from getting scared, [end up with her also getting scared.](https://imgur.com/BTAdzas) That was adorable af.  \nSICK HACK. Hiroi's band. [Slow Loop cameo](https://imgur.com/mZ7IESb). Personally, I prefer [Eliza](https://imgur.com/67cp1jc). She's cute and seems like we could get along when it comes to anisongs appreciation... A-Anyways! We finally see Hiroi perform! I was expecting a disaster live. But it was the opposite. It was amazing. I have never heard of any psychedelic rock in my whole life so this is a great new experience.  \nHiroi used to be like Bocchi back in the day. I guess alcohol plus gloomy introvert do sounds like a dangerous combination.  \n[Thank you to Ryou for summarizing my feelings for Nijika](https://imgur.com/2vwzTNJ). A full 180 of [strict Nijika](https://imgur.com/K5yYllX) and [kind Nijika](https://imgur.com/idCWScG) is the thing we all need to fix our half-assed way of life. Maji Tenshi.  \n[Kita and Bocchi's heartwarming scene.](https://imgur.com/lInqt35) Kita is such a good girl. We all know that she doesn't have any ill intentions when it comes to this matter. She just genuinely believes that Bocchi could do it. Now we can say for sure that she does fall in love with Bocchi's playing in episode 8.  \n[Looking forward next week](https://imgur.com/ery121T)!

It was predictable in the best possible way. KITAURA! And the fact that she actually knew, well... same deal. Kita's extroverted and kind of impulsive, but she's not a glittery airhead; she's actually kind and sensitive. The whole setup when she first came back to the band would never have happened if she hadn't been ashamed and embarrassed about ditching them because she felt like she couldn't keep up.\n\nI really should have expected Kikuri to be in a psych rock band. It fits almost too perfectly. The strong bass chops, the extreme chill, the substance abuse, the odd moments of wisdom... I've known a number of people in psych rock and stoner metal bands and clearly the show's writers have too. (And given the number of weeb guitarists I've met, Eliza is *perfect*.) I wish we'd gotten to hear more SICK HACK!\n\n...Her drinking problem still kinda makes my heart hurt, though. Knowing how it started almost makes it worse. I know it's not the kind of show where the grim realities of addiction would really fit with the tone and humor, but, dang.\n\nLowkey love that they're just casually calling her Ikuyo instead of Kita now because that is legit one of my favorite ever dumb name puns in anime.\n\nThe fact that despite Bocchi facing a real fear in this episode her freakouts were less frequent and much shorter makes me pretty happy.

izqqp9d,zhwvlv,"In this episode we got to see some sides to the other side characters that might have been hinted at but were more obvious.\n\nKita showed she has a self-centered and manipulative side when she lied about thinking Bocchi threw her form out by accident. I don't mind this as I think it's not just meant as a lazy way too kickstart the plot but to show a side of Kita we haven't seen, the fact she feel regret and apologizes when she could have gotten away with the lie also adds another layer.\n\nRyo I joke is the character most like me in the show, but this episode I was like...\n\n""She's so like me Fr Fr""\n\nIt was how she was so proud for striking out on her middle school festival doing her own thing, but then reveals it does indeed hurt her, it shows a less cool more vulnerable side of her, and also shows her greatest strength and weakness, that at the end of the day she goes with being authentic and herself even if it costs her, and despite the pain of that cost, she won't hesitate to do it again and again.\n\nNijicha showed she can be as scary as her older sister with her ""fuck around and find out.""\n\nBocchu re-enforces (again) that she is secretly quite narcissistic but feels ashamed of it. I admit I'm a bit fed up with Narcissistic performers spouting stupid ass shit.....*cough* Jennifer Lawrence *cough* for the most recent example. But in a sense I think the kind of people that desire and become performers there is something in them that has to enjoy the attention and has a least a seed of Narcissism that just comes with the territory. I think Bocchi is very good at capturing this despite it being at odds with her social anxiety.\n\nThe Bassest Kikori I kinda guessed ever since the first concert performance where she showed up that she might have been very much like Bocchi and is indeed shy and socially anxious and her alcholism is an escape from that. I kinda hope there is a time where we get an arc of either she growing from that, or Bocchi has a moment where she makes an effort to not walk down that path, because tbh I'm worried for Bocchi.\n\nThe Other members of sick hack include a Gaijin Weeb, and a straight man to complete with the alcholic mess....yeah that tracks.\n\nAt least Bocchi got her loans paid back by Ryo and Kikori after Seikia made them.\n\nThe visuals to show the psychedelic effect was pretty good, especially given the historical context of the genre of rock being played.\n\nOf course Bocchi after all the courage ghosts them......I wonder if she'll be convinced to go on at the last moment, or if we get an interesting subversion. Seeing how the band did Cameo in Slow Loop I have my suspicions on which one it'll be.\n\nStill never thought the Bocchi cliffhanger would be competing with *Raven at the Inner Palace* and *Beast Tamer* this week for stressful cliffhangers.",1670729822,t3_zhwvlv,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izqqp9d/

izoy7d1,zhwvlv,"Anxiety can be a total bitch and sometimes absolutely need external help to overcome it. Its a vicious circle of 'I want to be more social -> proceeds to not do it out of fear' and the feedback loop becomes worse because talking down to yourself is so common so the sentiment of 'Why am I so shit' becomes worse and worse which also alienates people more and more.\n\nI tried to make my year goal to be more social and it was honestly being a failure until I landed a new job with very social coworkers that understand my desire to not interact with people sometimes but still want to do outings from time to time (as contradictory as it sounds, I'm also confused myself so dw, doesn't make much sense to me either).\n\nIt all depends on the context for me. Dragging me to a party despite me saying that I don't feel like it is not a vibe for me and I find it annoying because parties are something I'm decidedly not into. On the other side of things, I have expressed that I wouldn't mind being able to talk to women I'm attracted to without feeling like my feet are melting. I avoided talking to a girl for months and I kept making shit up about her disliking me based on my gigabrain analysis of the single 5 sentence interaction I had with her and these dudes kept talking to me about stopping being a coward and like I *know* I'm not going anywhere by being a coward but ohmylord, I get so fucking nervous. In the end one of them made a bet with me, I talk to her and try to do something within a timeframe or next time they plan something I can't say No. They tried their darnest on giving advise and the pressure certainly helped since I ended up talking to her...just to find out she had a boyfriend, but what matters is that I learned that *gasp* she was a normal person and I was shitting bricks all the time for irrational reasons. It was *such* a relief, I legit felt something leaving my body because I finally did something I had been stalling for years. God I felt so powered up.\n\nAnnnnnnnnnnnnnd I lost my train of thought yet again discussing Bocchi. Anyways, we know that in this episodes Bocchi did want to enter the festival but her anxiety got in her way. Her 'teleporting' to the poll to find out she herself wrote the app is pretty self-evident on this. If she were in autopilot she would have done it herself but anxiety kicked in and she became unable too, so Kita's action feels more in-line to 'I got your back' thing (thought she admits she just wanted to see Bocchi perform). Personally I would also appreciate it a lot...internally cause I also have problem being actually grateful towards others so I would jokingly say ""Unforgivable"" as well but chances are my friends know I appreciate it...yeah I can be a bit of a drag...",1670700101,t1_izoob2s,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izoy7d1/

Promo monkeys who listed him as Protagonist cause many to hate and drop RE: CREATORS because he was a failure as the protagonist and often not in scenes because he was not the protagonist or main character it an esamble drama and the white haired book carrying girl hero Meltora if anything is the protagonist after all it revield she wrote RE:Creators. \nDon't skip the recap episode it the best one I've ever seen staring Meltora who makes it told from her point of view and changes herself to a sex pot in the process. \n\nIt says something about pre conceived notions. Because descriptions of the show written by the Promo Monkeys call the first charter the protagonist people watching the show ignored the character in the show saying I'm not the main character other are I'm just the narrator. \n\nPromo people who put together the promotional material for a show  often do not seek any input from the people making the show and often ignore information they are given in order to make the promo better in their opinion.

izyhbtq,zhwvlv,"I guess I might have been kind of unclear so if anyone still is reading this thread my main issues where that: \n\n1. Kita's decision to turn in the form has less context in the anime so it would be less clear to her that Bocchi actually wanted to perform. In the manga Bocchi doesn't immediately throw the form in the trash and Bocchi and Kita actually have a short conversation about the form while Bocchi is resting. Also, Bocchi doesn't actually throw it away until the day after. This means Kita would have had a much clearer idea it's actually something Bocchi wanted to do. \n\n2. The part with the coffin happens at school instead of starry and you also actually get to see Kita trying to retract the application. Some of the dialogue from that part was moved to starry instead but there was a panel with two random other students seeing Kita crouching next to the coffin and thinking Kita has become kind of weird after joining the band. I really really liked that one panel just because how funny I personally found a lot of the potential implications if you think about it (in the anime Starry could have had a coffin lying around, but in the manga Kita is the only one that could have brought the coffin so did she randomly go get a coffin from somewhere to put Bocchi in? Does the school have coffins lying around? And does other students acknowledging it mean they've randomly seen Kita do other weird stuff at school before? The panel also says three hours have passed since the previous part, so did Kita spend three hours getting a coffin for Bocchi or did she get the coffin quickly and then spend almost three hours watching over coffin Bocchi in a random hallway? Or did she go to class and just leave Bocchi like that until breaks rolled around? And why did she leave Bocchi lying in the hallway for three hours instead of moving her?)\n\nIt's a very insignificant detail in the grand scheme of things so I can get why it was skipped, but the first 9 episodes skipped very little and that kind of got my hopes up about seeing most of the fun smaller moments in the anime too.\n\nSo that's my main reason why I was kind of disappointed with the first part of the episode. I still liked it quite a bit, but if the first 9 episodes were a 10/10 then this one maybe felt more like an 8/10 to me (though obviously I probably wouldn't have minded if I hadn't already read the manga). \n\nAnd if you mean all the commas and parentheses, then yeah, I know I should probably work a bit on not using so many.\n\nAlso, thanks for actually answering instead of just downvoting! I'll keep in mind that I should try to explain more of my reasoning for why I feel stuff next time.",1670875005,t1_izxxxqy,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izyhbtq/
izq3t8z,zhwvlv,"Yeah, but I don't feel like I was being particularly rude about it and I don't think it's that weird for me to be a bit disappointed they skipped a part I like even if it's a great adaption overall (I mean, this is the source corner so I figure other people voting here would at least be aware the pacing in this episode is faster than several of the previous ones, and obviously other people are free to like that even if I would have preferred it to stay a little bit slower personally).\n\nSo I don't necessarily see how it makes sense for people to downvote because of that, especially since I for instance also feel like I see people mention stuff they like better and worse in the anime compared to the manga in the source corner of other anime without people necessarily being downvoted for having either opinion (and in this case this is also the only episode I wouldn't unhesitatingly say the anime version is better for even if it also had some cool additions, which makes me feel more like the anime did some things better and the manga did some things better for this one). \n\nEdit: and if any part of it does come across as rude or disrespectful I promise that's 100 % unintentional \n\nSo, the short version is that I'm confused about being downvoted for being a bit disappointed with skipped content in the source corner, where that kind of discussion seems pretty common for many other anime (at least those I've watched and read the threads for).\n\nAnd if this seems like a lot of overanalyzing to anyone reading this, then yeah, it absolutely is and my habit of doing that is part of why I find Bocchi very relatable sometimes (I'm obviously not always quite as extreme as her)",1670718207,t1_izp2eyd,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izq3t8z/

izob5zp,zhwuck,"I like to think that Nightfall believed all her efforts prove herself to Twilight paid off when he tackled her out of the way of the bullet; probably thinking he was so impressed by her that he couldn't even wait until the match was over to hug her. And the ""hangover"" excuse might've been a bluff, but since this is Twilight we're talking about, he could most likely do all this crazy shit with an actual hangover.  \n\nBut god damn, a tennis match has no right to go this hard. I'd watch the sport more IRL if the players did ninja flips and used gadgets like rockets or whips. Even the Campbell brother got inspired by their moves.  \n\nThough the crowning moment goes to the match between Yor and Fiona of course. They didn't just animate it breaking the ground underneath, they made it look like Yor put her damn ki into the ball to send it flying lmao. But props to Fiona; she may not have stopped it, but I like to think she slowed it down enough that the ball didn't destroy that tree or the building behind it.  \n\nOnce again, it serves her right for trying to break the Forgers apart, but also once again, it's sad (but also kinda hilarious) to see her completely breaking down and crying over the loss. Her training in the mountains afterwards was great too; I was worried they'd leave that out for a second.  \n\nPoor Loid, though.

No wonder he took the loss as a point to grow on and was inspired by Loid, who responds in kind with some motivational speech. even Papa Campbell was happy this turned into a learning experience for his kids despite how much money he lost.  \n  \nOf course it can't be as smooth as them just getting the painting they needed as a reward, since state security is on the move, but Twilight and Nightfall are still expert spies and masters at subterfuge.   \n  \nThose are some snazzy WISE jackets!  \n  \nI love how Fiona talks about giving the jewelry to Sylvia and we actually see her wearing them in the briefing room.   \n  \nFiona has finally had enough of Yor hogging Twilight and her rightful position as matriarch of the Forger Family, and the only way to settle this is an impromptu tennis match! But the audience (and Loid) both know how this is going to go (and Yor is in this to win it).  \n  \nAnya confusing tennis with baseball is so Anya. As is her ordering Bond to get the tennis balls.  \n  \nAnya finally understands the appeal of romance dramas when she sees how exciting the tension between Fiona and Yor is. I guess that's one way to interest her in something that's not cartoons.   \n  \nYor murders tennis balls! And then shoots them like they're projectiles hurtling at the speed of light! It's actually kind of beautiful! Meanwhile Fiona has the most hilarious expressions on her face but manages to endure it admirably, powered by her love for Twilight. Of course the racket couldn't take so much power, so Fiona is left the loser. Not that she'll give up, even if it means her mask finally slipping and her turning into a blushing crying mess as she crazily drives away for a mountain training arc to learn how to hit back Yor's shots. Perfect cap off to Nightfall in this storyline.  \n  \nLoid talking about their marriage of convenience while Yor genuinely wants praise and acknowledgement for beating her love rival! You gotta love it.  \n  \nSo all this was because a husband wanted to keep his admiration and love of young and attractive actresses hidden for the sake of his family. In the end he was just a very embarassing and devoted father and husband, which Loid can kind of relate to now that he's acting as one. I love the expression on his daughters' face in the picture.  \n  \nHuh, Yor seems surprisingly serious at the end. Could she be contemplating her feelings for Loid?  \n  \nNext week: Anya and Becky Ooting! Damian! And Loid's mom!?",1670691899,t3_zhwuck,/r/anime/comments/zhwuck/spy_x_family_part_2_episode_23_discussion/izoe889/

izplr1f,zhwuck,"All those tricks - ALL those tricks, and at the end of the day, you just can't beat Loid and Fiona! The part where Loid tackles Fiona had me surprised. I saw it coming, but still, I was jumping up and down after that because I knew Fiona would get all excited about it. As much as I love Yor and ultimately support her, I still can't help but be happy when Fiona gets happy too.\n\nI also love how the already wild match gets progressively crazier and crazier. From the court manipulation we saw last episode, to raising the net, and then they start bringing in snipers and ballboys who are shooting chaff or something. At the end of it, the Foneys are doing so many weird tricks and spins that the announcer gives up and says he has absolutely no idea what they're doing anymore. ""Drunken boxing from the east"" had me on the floor. \n\nAnd though they win, Carol is a graceful loser. He even manages to get some praise from Loid, who tells him to practice honestly. \n\nThere is a small hitch in the plan. Despite being promised to be able to get anything out of Mr. Campbell's collection, the Lady in the Sun turns out to have been pockmarked by government officials for taking. I was wondering if Loid was hiding in the bag or something when Fiona walked in by herself, but no, he disguised himself as the butler and swapped the painting with a fake while no one was looking. Fiona ends up taking a few strange-looking trinkets and we later see Handler wearing them! I feel bad for the government guys. They'll be spending a lot of time looking on the fake painting for a code that does not exist.\n\nHowever, it's just as for naught here - turns out the secret the Colonel was hiding wasn't about some big East-West wartime secret but his love of theater idols. This man was a legit gacha player in the 1950s. \n\nJumping back a little bit, we have Fiona challenging Yor to a match as they head back to base to deliver the painting. Yor may not know that there was a secret mission, but knows that Fiona might be threatening her place as wife. The details are wrong in her imagination but she gets the basic idea. And then there's Anya thinking about Becky talking about Berlint Love. I feel Anya, I was thinking about that sort of soap opera battle right then and there too. \n\nDespite everything she has overcome, despite all the wild madness of the competition, it's regular housewife Yor in a friendly and crude casual match that manages to be the wildest. First she annihilates the ball (can we get an F for Mr. Ball?) and then she launches a freaking missile of a serve at Fiona. I totally saw that racket break incoming btw - Fiona's love for Loid might be powerful, but a racket does not know such emotions. I'm surprised Yor's racket didn't break either. In the end, after losing, Fiona runs off in a very Yuri-like manner. Yor proudly proclaims that she beat Fiona to Loid, and while he's supportive...he doesn't really get the message. There's a bit of an ""and?"" energy coming from him.\n\nAnd yep, going back to the analysis, it was all for nothing! No secret, no nothing, except that the Colonel was a degenerate like all of us. Loid is in denial at first, but the Handler says that she's ultimately alright with it, which gets Loid to be happy too. And after seeing the photo of the colonel with his family, decides to buy his family some snacks too. I hope we see Loid giving them the snacks next week, because Yor is looking pretty sad! And poor Fiona is practicing tennis in the woods, despite it all being long over.\n\nThat's it for this week! I can't wait for next week - the preview showed us some *interesting* things. One of the most notable things that I saw was what looked like a young Loid! I wonder what that's about?

The organisers were terrified of that happening (as it happened, Germany was set to play Australasia in the semi final), so they ordered all telegraph lines and newspapers to the team hotels be stopped, and the game was played out from 30 July to August 1st with the players unaware of any progress. \n\nAs it happened, the Brits only joined the war on August 4th, so the match would have happened regardless. It would have been interesting to see if the information could have been hidden from the players long enough if Germany had won the semi final and been set to play Britain in the final though\n\nAs another sidenote, the German players never reached Germany.

As such, 90s anime fans had to school those fans of the finer points of anime's appeal, which was NOT about the frame rates.\n\nOf course, now that the Western 2D animation industry has become so scarce outside of educational cartoons, Fox animation, and the odd offerings on specialty cartoon cable networks, that same attitude ""moar frame rates"" in the 90s has shifted to modern anime.\n\nI think modern anime is extremely technically polished. But I do agree that visual and cinematic experimentation isn't always appreciated as much now, even by those working in the anime industry. It's like they're afraid of being mocked by modern fans sometimes for pushing the envelope a bit in terms of staging, layout and art direction.",1670689798,t3_zhvq56,/r/anime/comments/zhvq56/do_you_ever_feel_disillusioned_with_the_modern/izo94fw/
