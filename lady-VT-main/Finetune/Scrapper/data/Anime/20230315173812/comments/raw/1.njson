I gotta say, it was definitely a bold move on the directors to do something like this, and I respect them for trying something new. Now, if I were keeping up this while it aired weekly, I'm sure I would be feeling a certain type of way. But the privileges of the internet allow me to binge it and analyze all the small differences from episode to episode, which I probably wouldn't have picked up on a week-to-week basis.   \nOne thing I find very cool about it is that they don't reuse any scenes, every shot is framed differently, even if it's the same events. If I were into filmmaking or cinematography, this would be a great resource for learning about those types of things. I like that they manage to stay creative in how they present things, such as the last scene in the 5th episode where the camera rotates with the ticking clock, which was pretty damn cool to me.  \nThe atmosphere is also different from episode to episode. Some episodes are lighter in tone, and some are downright unnerving at times.   \nI can't say I watched every second of every episode, because I value my time slightly more than that, but I did skim through using arrow keys to make sure I caught all the little details. I also wanted to make sure I heard all the music, too, because they used a bunch of new ones that I don't think I've heard before. The OST is pretty stellar, and I don't want to miss any.   \nSpeaking of music, I can only count a handful of times when I've skipped the OP or ED, but this is one of those times. Not because either of them are bad, in fact I quite like the emphasis between the music and the visuals, but I just don't think I can handle more monotony (even if the scenes aren't completely identical). I'll probably go back to listening to them afterwards, though.  \nAlso, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.  \nThere are a whole bunch of other miniscule differences I could write down, but they're not worth mentioning, and everyone has probably already noticed them, anyways.  \nNow did the ending make all of this worth it? ... I'm not sure about that. I feel like more could have been done or built up over the eight episodes to create a more satisfying conclusion.

I gotta say, it was definitely a bold move on the directors to do something like this, and I respect them for trying something new. Now, if I were keeping up this while it aired weekly, I&#39;m sure I would be feeling a certain type of way. But the privileges of the internet allow me to binge it and analyze all the small differences from episode to episode, which I probably wouldn&#39;t have picked up on a week-to-week basis.<br/>\nOne thing I find very cool about it is that they don&#39;t reuse any scenes, every shot is framed differently, even if it&#39;s the same events. If I were into filmmaking or cinematography, this would be a great resource for learning about those types of things. I like that they manage to stay creative in how they present things, such as the last scene in the 5th episode where the camera rotates with the ticking clock, which was pretty damn cool to me.<br/>\nThe atmosphere is also different from episode to episode. Some episodes are lighter in tone, and some are downright unnerving at times.<br/>\nI can&#39;t say I watched every second of every episode, because I value my time slightly more than that, but I did skim through using arrow keys to make sure I caught all the little details. I also wanted to make sure I heard all the music, too, because they used a bunch of new ones that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard before. The OST is pretty stellar, and I don&#39;t want to miss any.<br/>\nSpeaking of music, I can only count a handful of times when I&#39;ve skipped the OP or ED, but this is one of those times. Not because either of them are bad, in fact I quite like the emphasis between the music and the visuals, but I just don&#39;t think I can handle more monotony (even if the scenes aren&#39;t completely identical). I&#39;ll probably go back to listening to them afterwards, though.<br/>\nAlso, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I&#39;m not sure he&#39;s the normal human being he thinks he is.<br/>\nThere are a whole bunch of other miniscule differences I could write down, but they&#39;re not worth mentioning, and everyone has probably already noticed them, anyways.<br/>\nNow did the ending make all of this worth it? ... I&#39;m not sure about that. I feel like more could have been done or built up over the eight episodes to create a more satisfying conclusion. What we got wasn&#39;t bad, and implies something more to Haruhi and Kyon&#39;s relationship I guess, but I felt like it could have been more ... climactic?

Different camera angles, changing where the characters were or went during the different events, focussing on separate aspects each time...KyoAni put a <em>lot</em> of work into this arc. </p>\n\n<p>I just wish it didn&#39;t outstay its welcome.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq1rag/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670717210.0, "author_flair_text": ":BI::BJ:", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 17, "_fetched": true}

I was skipping through some scenes in the last episode cause I wanted to get to the part where they broke the time loop.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqh87b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670724901.0, "author_flair_text": ":EA::EB::M:https://myanimelist.net/profile/JetsLag", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "#2e51a2", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 9, "_fetched": true}

ONE EPISODE REMAINS.**\n\n- More cicadas!\n- Oh THAT\u2019S a fun little overhead panning shot at 00:05: it uses a concave lens in order to show the warping of time, making everything look kind of like something closed in on itself.\n- OST use good again this episode.\n- \u201cKyon-kun, denwa.\u201d\n- Color palette and the plant out of focus in the foreground at 00:45 gives a washed-out feeling to the shot, similar to E8-2.\n- The baserunner\u2019s expression at 01:13 is probably going to be foreshadowing for Kyon at the end of this final loop.\n- Ants carrying away the wings of a dead cicada at 01:21.  That\u2019s unlikely to be just a scene; we are reaching the end of the cicadas, and likewise the endless summer.  Especially when it\u2019s overlaid over Kyon\u2019s line about how summer is already over.\n- Right, there are exactly eight characters in Endless Eight\u2019s name.  Should have noticed it earlier, this episode makes it easy.  Sasuga Nagaru Tanigawa!  (Also I think they may be back to normal writing, another hint that this is the final loop.)\n- Haruhi has best outfit here at the first meetup today, Mikuru\u2019s doesn\u2019t quite flatter her.  (Koizumi keeps getting disqualified for looking too prep, Kyon doesn\u2019t give a rat\u2019s ass.)\n- Dutch angle for the \u201csummer should be like summer, so we have to do summer activities\u201d line? That\u2019s a new one for this loop.  Also it focuses the camera on Haruhi\u2019s crotch (might be more than just fanservice, ulterior motives for spending time with Kyon go!), but we get a little something for everyone \u2013 Kyon\u2019s position and the way his clothes bag emphasize his ass as well.\n- Quick cuts for deja vu, I do believe.\n- Pan down to beach ball\u2026 cut to Haruhi\u2019s beachballs.  Heh.\n- Also, FINAL LOOP\u2019S SWIMWEAR: orange side-tie bikini (pretty sure it counts and isn\u2019t just a two piece) for Haruhi, frilly pink polka-dotted one piece with skirt for Mikuru (shouldn\u2019t work on her but does, but I think Haruhi probably has the better suit this loop), green one-piece with a light green vertical stripe down the front for Yuki (she may have worn this one before actually), blue long swim trunks with a white stripe down each side for Koizumi, teal long swim trunks with a cyan-ish vertical stripe down from where the pockets are/would go for Kyon.  (It\u2019s the important things in life.)\n- Okay, props to Sugita Tomozaku for his delivery of the \u201crestrain yourself!  Can\u2019t you read the No Diving sign?\u201d at around 04:00.  (It\u2019s deeper than his usual Kyon voice and I think that\u2019s intentional for humor; it works.)\n- What\u2019s that, screentime of two boys with well-defined physiques that focuses on their chests?  See, the fanservice is equal-opportunity today!\n- Well well well well.  There\u2019s a sneaky little shot: Yuki floating down the pool on the front of the screen towards the left but looking right around 04:43, with the camera focusing more on Haruhi and Mikuru in the background so you might not notice.  Yuki is moving into the future but still focusing on the past, then?\n- 04:47: sore demo alert!\n- Bored Yuki continues to be very bored.\n- 05:42: Note Yuki sitting in the shade while both Koizumi and Kyon sit in the sunlight.  Welcome to the melancholy of Yuki Nagato.  (Also this plus Japanese reading the screen right to left might be setup for [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]; I\u2019m actually quite reminded of something in the visuals for Colorful from Rebellion.)\n- Oooh, 05:55.  We get sepia for Kyon looking at Yuki (sepia being the tone of flashbacks, visual indicator of deja vu), but also notice Kyon being framed in light here as he notices \u2013 he\u2019s seen the metaphorical light by noticing Yuki.\n- Haruhi following this up by moving so that her shadow covers Kyon thus blocking him from the light is also interesting.  (Was the animator for this scene a Kyon/Yuki shipper?  Could just be Haruhi and her force of personality blocking out Kyon thinking about the deja vu.)\n- Fish-eye lens at 06:32.  (Also Mikuru\u2019s outfit does work better on her in this light.)\n- And oh would you look at that, Kyon is still in the offset seat to the side that he was in last episode but that Yuki was in in all episodes before that.  Funny that.  More on that\u2026 later.  ([CLASSIFIED INFORMATION])\n- (Note to self: Broadcast order post-2009 would probably actually work better if you switched the positions of Sighs and E8.)\n- Haruhi\u2019s outfit ALSO works better on her in this light.  Gorgeous isn\u2019t quite the right word; \u201cyou look extremely attractive in this, Haruhi\u201d is about right.\n- Sad bored Yuki just looking at her drink at 07:30.  (Hug.  Hug.  Hug.)\n- Just showing the hand gesture for Haruhi waving everyone free?  I don\u2019t actually know what to make of that.\n- In this final loop Yuki leaves in the same direction as everyone else, off towards the left\u2026 oh, that\u2019ll be final loop foreshadowing again, they all get to go off into the future after this.\n- Ooh, Yuki blink as she (white lies and) tells Kyon she\u2019s all right.  Note how we didn\u2019t get many Yuki blinks in the early episodes but we are getting them late?  Funny that.\n- Extremely low-angle shot of Kyon and his shadow at 08:12 as he wonders why he called out to her. The shadow faces right; just the long shadow of past loops then?\n- It\u2019s between Yuki and Haruhi for best yukata today and it\u2019s close (though not like Mikuru\u2019s is bad, but while part of me thinks it goes great the other part thinks the shade of yellow \u2013 or possibly white colored by the lighting \u2013 is just a little wrong for her), but shout to Kyon, that olive vest he\u2019s wearing actually works for him IMO even if it\u2019s a little too loose.\n- This loop\u2019s Yuki mask: an alien one to end the cycle.  This could not be a metaphor, no never.  It\u2019s not like the entire point of this is that the artificial human Yuki is increasingly a real human just wearing an alien mask, no never.  (Also remember that alien as representing the autism spectrum is a take with a long vintage.)\n- OST cutoff as Kyon resolves to ask Haruhi about her homework.  (Quiet point I should have remembered/thought of earlier: Kyon asking about this is probably his him hinting that he\u2019d like to do homework with everyone.  I know you get this same kind of subtle hinting when it comes to Japanese dating.)\n- Also yes, funny that they make sure to keep the homework lines in every episode, yes?\n- Fanservice for everyone; now we get a subtle Yuki butt focus shot at 10:30.\n- See also: Haruhi positioned in the montage shot at 10:39 so that her own butt and her legs are centered in the screen.  And Mikuru falling right after that in a way that emphasizes *her* ass.\n- Yuki rhinoceros beetle catch GET!\n- Also LOL at Haruhi catching Mikuru while going for another cicade at 10:42.\n- Well well well, would you look at that.  One cicada actually came back this time, even landing on the net.  Why, they did return the favor!  Another indicator this is the FINAL ~~LAP~~ LOOP.\n- Another day, another good Haruhi casual outfit this loop at 11:45.\n- Huh.  Different framing at 12:19, with us seeing Kyon straight from the side looking towards the wall but to our eyes looking towards the window.  Actually reminds me of Shaft style somehow.  Also he\u2019s looking into the past, I suppose.\n- Props to the subbers for trying to get across Mikuru\u2019s blubbering here!\n- PROTECC THE MIKURU AND THE YUKI.\n- Yuuko Gotou outdid herself this time around I see (and, more importantly, hear).\n- Well well well well.  What have we here, two moths fluttering around a lit streetlamp.  This is A Thing in Japanese cinematography, though I forget exactly what it means.  (I\u2019m used to associating it with impending death, but that\u2019s not the case here.  Impending doom maybe, where the doom is the loop?)\n- \u201cWe\u2019ve entered an endless recursion of time!\u201d\n- The choice of framing Koizumi by his folded arms and legs at 13:46 is notable.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fanservice, but I\u2019m not sure what the point is.  (He\u2019s hiding some of his thoughts?)\n- Note all four of them in a group framed facing left/towards the future at 14:23, unlike past loops.\n- Nice shot of the shadows on the floor at 14:35 as Koizumi talks about Haruhi having lingering regrets/something she wants to do, a metaphorical shadow over the proceedings.  But in fact there is a deeper layer here, since the real issue is another metaphorical shadow over the proceedings: the impending doom of homework looming over Kyon.\n- Butterfly or moth at 14:44, more time loop symbolism I do believe.  (But now fluttering to the left into the future, hmm?)\n- Note the trash can with its lid ajar off to the side at 14:53\u2026 and unlike the other version of this scene where we got this, this time the open can is the one to the left.\n- Also note how quickly this version of this scene is progressing relative to previous ones.  I wonder why?\n- Welllll then.   Note 15:10\u2026 where Koizumi gestures *towards the screen* while talking about how one person remembers everything.  He\u2019s talking about Yuki\u2026 but he is gesturing towards you the viewer, who also remember everything of the last eight episodes.  (This entire adaptation choice is about putting you in Yuki\u2019s shoes.)\n- \u201cWho is that?\u201d  The person whose eyes are out of frame (not just hidden) when you ask that at 15:12, Kyon.  I like visual answers!  And visual answer cuts too, and we get one of those right after with the cut to Yuki\u2019s face.\n- Ooof, Yuki\u2019s expression and hidden eyes at 15:31.\n- REACTION SHOT!  Wide eyes and then the can dropping to the ground!  (And the can starts spinning in a loop, heh.  But note: it spins *clockwise*.)\n- And then a blatant Dutch angle immediately after this for more emphasis.\n- LOTS of Dutch angles, now with fish-eye lens as well at 15:57.\n- Can on the ground remains blunt loop symbolism\u2026 oh, but it\u2019s also Yuki\u2019s silent cry for help (second episode of this arc with this motif), heh.  \u201cI have no mouth and I must scream.\u201d", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_izqlbab", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":DC:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/7natxx00jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DC", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":DD:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/q070d130jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DD", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":U:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/54iq6jbdq3aa1_t5_2qh22/U", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":I:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/fbcu01wmf65a1_t5_2qh22/I", "e": "emoji"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><h3>Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):</h3>\n\n<p><strong>DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY.

The interesting thing is the camera on the phone pointing at you the viewer when Haruhi represents the show and Kyon represents audience and author \u2013 the show looking to see what Tanigawa will do and what your reactions to it will be?\n- \u201cKyon-kun, denwa.\u201d\n- This is not as well directed and my hand is complaining about last episode\u2019s writeup so imma slack a bit.  Still, 00:27 sticks out too \u2013 off angle emphasizing the offness of the situation, probably.\n- 00:46 with the phone would probably have more of a point if I could read moonrunes.  Though really part of that is the name and the other part is probably just length of call so.  Note the subtle zoom, and the cut to a cloud screensaver (clouds again!) right afterwards.\n- Yet more cloud emphasis with the pan to the clouds outside as Kyon talks about how summer\u2019s already over (once again).\n- More nifty tricks with the Endless Eight title card.\n- Shot of Kyon looking at his feet to shot disorientation again (I think) at 03:04.\n- (Bored Yuki is still bored but the counter is suspended for the sake of my hand.)\n- Welp, 03:29.  Haruhi knows what she\u2019s doing.  Also, since Kyon is the audience her resting her breasts on his head probably has a meta point \u2013 Haruhi the show is kind of doing the same thing to the audience.  (Reinforced by the pan to her face looking right at the screen as she starts talking to Kyon.)\n- THIS LOOP\u2019S SWIMWEAR: Striped red two-piece for Haruhi, frilly cyan/light blue one-piece for Mikuru, stock school swimsuit for Yuki (old flap style one I think?), long olive trunks for Kyon\u2026 OH SHIT IT\u2019S THE SPEEDO EPISODE (but only for Koizumi, thought it was both).  That\u2019ll win him Best Swimsuit today I think, especially with the other swimsuits all being meh except maybe Mikuru\u2019s (it does not look bad on her at all).\n- (I just had the mental image of a Haruhi/Bikki teamup.  THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED.)\n- Quick pan today to represent Koizumi\u2019s deja vu at the world-altering events line.\n- Extremely obvious butterfly shot at 04:40, that\u2019ll be the repurposing of the Butterfly of Death and Rebirth for time loops again.  (Also they\u2019re even more obvious about how bored Yuki is this episode.)\n- LOL Mikuru belly flop.  (Also the frills are specifically just a skirt.)\n- Kyon noticed the bored Yuki!  (Also there\u2019s some Dutch angles around, but that counter is in abeyance as well.)\n- 05:30 is another \u201cthis probably has more meanings if you can read moonrunes\u201d shot.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~5:05 P.M. I think?)\n- Concave lens for the eatery scene introduction this time.\n- Mikuru\u2019s casual outfits have been on point this episode so far.\n- Note the lack of a visible exit sign so far this time; we all know at this point we\u2019re here for the long haul.\n- Never mind, there it is at 06:29.  But it\u2019s small and out of focus in the distance, so same effect.\n- HNNNGH that look on Yuki\u2019s face at 07:03.  (A key part here is that Kyon is the only person who checks in on her and she recognizes that, even if I think she\u2019s also somewhat irritated that he keeps doing this without realizing it.)\n- 07:09 is blatant: visual separation via Kyon walking away, he actually came over to check in on her world but is now walking back away from it.  (And it\u2019s where we get the crows cawing, too.)\n- The festival clearly being held in a baseball stadium this time around draws a direct comparison line to the baseball game on TV at the start of the loop.\n- Sepia filter for Kyon stating that he gets the feeling he owes her, heh.\n- Oh, that\u2019s because it\u2019s shot through the eye of the mask for this loop (another robot/tokusatsu one), giving us a really meat transition at 08:12.\n- Yeah, they\u2019re probably supposed to be fireworks particles, but something about the effect at ~08:43 is making me go \u201cdango, dango, dango, dango, dango daikazoku\u2026\u201d  (specifically by comparison to a shot at the end of that ED).\n- LOL Yuki looking right at Mr. Hasn\u2019t Done His Homework.\n- Hello reflection shot at 09:41.\n- That confirms it\u2019s a statue at the park.  (Fountain centerpiece I think.)  Also even more gathering thunderclouds (the incident is brewing again).\n- Strange beetle.  (Not a rhinoceros this time I think, though I think it might actually be the same kind\nas loops 2 and 4.)  Also Yuki knows it\u2019s not a cicada by now so is probably showing off for Kyon, no?\n- Or maybe not the same, this time Kyon namedrops the Yanbaru scarab.\n- Datto shitemo alert!  (Sucks to be Sky.)\n- Panning shot at 10:19 flashes.  Because panorama maybe?\n- It IS the Eva reference episode!  (Also Mikuru getting her head out of the frog costume a cute.)\n- Best Haruhi casual outfit of the episode so far here.\n- I have missed making a \u201cHauu~!  Haruhi wants to take the frog costume home with her!!!!\u201d joke for five episodes now, let\u2019s fix that.\n- WATCH WATCH.\n- Extremely huggable Yuki at 11:35.\n- Kyon responding to the phone with \u201cthe number you have dialed is not [currently in service]\u201d before cutting himself off because Mikuru this time around is a nice touch.\n- A second use this episode of the phone receiving screen for effect.  Must be a point to that.\n- Huh, a shot of delinquents at 12:15 that\u2019s new to this episode.  Not sure what\u2019s up with that, could just be setting the scene though.\n- We get an unnaturally saturated color palette to show the strangeness of the situation this time around.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~1:52 A.M.)  Now with another time loop butterfly, that makes three uses so far this episode.\n- Yuki sitting hunched on the ground in near-fetal position along with Mikuru is another subtle show of her deteriorating mental state.\n- WATCH WATCH.  (Same time I think, also the design represents the loops because of course.)\n- MUST\u2026 HUG\u2026 AND\u2026 COMFORT\u2026 YUKI\u2026\n- Props to Yuuko Gotou for her rendition of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line here, that was well-acted.\n- Oh shit Mikuru is wearing dolphin shorts, isn\u2019t she?  I approve!\n- 15:23 flashes; again, Japanese film culture has a thing about power lines.\n- At a meta level, note the \u201call deja vu is the result of remembering similar events in past lives\u201d reincarnation take.  (Actual Western occultism (not sure about Eastern) doesn\u2019t tend to agree with this, amusingly enough, despite belief in reincarnation also being common there; instead the common theory there goes off the astral plane concept and posits that time does not flow linearly at that level so events in the future can be remembered in the past\u2026 which actually also isn\u2019t that far from our time loop here, come to think of it...)\n- Okay Mikuru is also looking extremely huggable at 15:59.\n- Hey, Kyon realized who Koizumi was talking about without needing to be told!  (As reinforced by centering Yuki in the middle of the screen here, focusing your attention on her a second before he speaks up.)  And look at Yuki moving her eyes to look at Kyon as he asks about this.\n- Yuki blink!\n- Holy shit that piano track that fires up after 15,521 works well here.  Sad, emotional, almost tragic, it fits the mood they\u2019re going for perfectly.\n- Shit, I almost missed Mikuru being shocked as well.\n- More blinks.  Keep an eye on that, it might be a visual representation of Yuki slowly getting more human.\n- Hey look, he has a calculator to do the math this time!  (I can actually get close through mental math via shortcuts \u2013 15,498 the original end loop being close to 15,600 which is 600 x 26 (26 two-week periods in a year) exact helps and I did mental math competitions in school back in the day \u2013 but not precisely.)\n- And we have FINALLY ticked up to 595 years.\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- HNNGH 18:28 HUG THE YUKI.\n- Also a blunt visual separation shot right after at 18:33.\n- 18:47 because Yuki thinks of herself as an observer (much like that telescope, which might be why she keeps looking through it earlier in addition to looking where it points here) and also a slightly panoramic shot which might be intended to give the impression of an IMAX planetarium.\n- Huh, airplane.  (Also Yuki remains infinitely huggable and infinitely in need of hugs or some other kind of emotional support.)\n- Huh, we get the observer line during the test of courage this time instead of during baseball.  I actually like that choice, this is in many ways Yuki\u2019s emotional test (far beyond what she ever should have had to handle).\n- The thundercloud at 19:55 is more developed than earlier in the episode, which will indicate the gathering metaphorical storm as we approach August 31.\n- Another stadium shot at 20:10, again calling back to the game at the beginning.\n- Another episode with a sore de and then a sore demo (20:21), wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s actually in the original LN.\n- The rotating playground thing whose name I forget at 20:29 is another blunt visual metaphor; note the rotation is counterclockwise and Haruhi is pushing it, which is extremely obvious and almost certainly has nothing to do with Great Mandala movements at all in this case.  (Haruhi is after all literally turning the clock back!)\n- And I typed that BEFORE they started rotating the world around the nearly stationary playground equipment towards the end of that shot.\n- Kyon drawing that infinity-looking eight at 20:42 is the bluntest thing in the world.  \u201cYou have realized we\u2019re doing this for the full eight episodes by this point, right?\u201d\n- Okay, Koizumi has best swimsuit this episode but Mikuru wins best casual outfit in a walk, she has like three really good ones this episode including this last one here at 20:51.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_izqjz82", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":DC:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/7natxx00jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DC", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":DD:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/q070d130jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DD", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":U:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/54iq6jbdq3aa1_t5_2qh22/U", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":I:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/fbcu01wmf65a1_t5_2qh22/I", "e": "emoji"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><h3>Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Clouds again, also a tilted unlit lantern (going left, heh) to emphasize that something is wrong.</li>\n<li>Discarded cicada nymph shell, probably yet more references to a certain other work.</li>\n<li>00:22 is deliberate and has to be for effect.

Note the subtle zoom, and the cut to a cloud screensaver (clouds again!) right afterwards.</li>\n<li>Yet more cloud emphasis with the pan to the clouds outside as Kyon talks about how summer\u2019s already over (once again).</li>\n<li>More nifty tricks with the Endless Eight title card.</li>\n<li>Shot of Kyon looking at his feet to shot disorientation again (I think) at 03:04.</li>\n<li>(Bored Yuki is still bored but the counter is suspended for the sake of my hand.)</li>\n<li>Welp, 03:29.  Haruhi knows what she\u2019s doing.  Also, since Kyon is the audience her resting her breasts on his head probably has a meta point \u2013 Haruhi the show is kind of doing the same thing to the audience.  (Reinforced by the pan to her face looking right at the screen as she starts talking to Kyon.)</li>\n<li>THIS LOOP\u2019S SWIMWEAR: Striped red two-piece for Haruhi, frilly cyan/light blue one-piece for Mikuru, stock school swimsuit for Yuki (old flap style one I think?), long olive trunks for Kyon\u2026 OH SHIT IT\u2019S THE SPEEDO EPISODE (but only for Koizumi, thought it was both).  That\u2019ll win him Best Swimsuit today I think, especially with the other swimsuits all being meh except maybe Mikuru\u2019s (it does not look bad on her at all).</li>\n<li>(I just had the mental image of a Haruhi/Bikki teamup.  THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED.)</li>\n<li>Quick pan today to represent Koizumi\u2019s deja vu at the world-altering events line.</li>\n<li>Extremely obvious butterfly shot at 04:40, that\u2019ll be the repurposing of the Butterfly of Death and Rebirth for time loops again.  (Also they\u2019re even more obvious about how bored Yuki is this episode.)</li>\n<li>LOL Mikuru belly flop.  (Also the frills are specifically just a skirt.)</li>\n<li>Kyon noticed the bored Yuki!  (Also there\u2019s some Dutch angles around, but that counter is in abeyance as well.)</li>\n<li>05:30 is another \u201cthis probably has more meanings if you can read moonrunes\u201d shot.</li>\n<li>CLOCK CLOCK.  (~5:05 P.M. I think?)</li>\n<li>Concave lens for the eatery scene introduction this time.</li>\n<li>Mikuru\u2019s casual outfits have been on point this episode so far.</li>\n<li>Note the lack of a visible exit sign so far this time; we all know at this point we\u2019re here for the long haul.</li>\n<li>Never mind, there it is at 06:29.  But it\u2019s small and out of focus in the distance, so same effect.</li>\n<li>HNNNGH that look on Yuki\u2019s face at 07:03.  (A key part here is that Kyon is the only person who checks in on her and she recognizes that, even if I think she\u2019s also somewhat irritated that he keeps doing this without realizing it.)</li>\n<li>07:09 is blatant: visual separation via Kyon walking away, he actually came over to check in on her world but is now walking back away from it.  (And it\u2019s where we get the crows cawing, too.)</li>\n<li>The festival clearly being held in a baseball stadium this time around draws a direct comparison line to the baseball game on TV at the start of the loop.</li>\n<li>Sepia filter for Kyon stating that he gets the feeling he owes her, heh.</li>\n<li>Oh, that\u2019s because it\u2019s shot through the eye of the mask for this loop (another robot/tokusatsu one), giving us a really meat transition at 08:12.</li>\n<li>Yeah, they\u2019re probably supposed to be fireworks particles, but something about the effect at ~08:43 is making me go \u201cdango, dango, dango, dango, dango daikazoku\u2026\u201d  (specifically by comparison to a shot at the end of that ED).</li>\n<li>LOL Yuki looking right at Mr. Hasn\u2019t Done His Homework.</li>\n<li>Hello reflection shot at 09:41.</li>\n<li>That confirms it\u2019s a statue at the park.  (Fountain centerpiece I think.)  Also even more gathering thunderclouds (the incident is brewing again).</li>\n<li>Strange beetle.  (Not a rhinoceros this time I think, though I think it might actually be the same kind\nas loops 2 and 4.)  Also Yuki knows it\u2019s not a cicada by now so is probably showing off for Kyon, no?</li>\n<li>Or maybe not the same, this time Kyon namedrops the Yanbaru scarab.</li>\n<li>Datto shitemo alert!  (Sucks to be Sky.)</li>\n<li>Panning shot at 10:19 flashes.  Because panorama maybe?</li>\n<li>It IS the Eva reference episode!  (Also Mikuru getting her head out of the frog costume a cute.)</li>\n<li>Best Haruhi casual outfit of the episode so far here.</li>\n<li>I have missed making a \u201cHauu~!  Haruhi wants to take the frog costume home with her!!!!\u201d joke for five episodes now, let\u2019s fix that.</li>\n<li>WATCH WATCH.</li>\n<li>Extremely huggable Yuki at 11:35.</li>\n<li>Kyon responding to the phone with \u201cthe number you have dialed is not [currently in service]\u201d before cutting himself off because Mikuru this time around is a nice touch.</li>\n<li>A second use this episode of the phone receiving screen for effect.  Must be a point to that.</li>\n<li>Huh, a shot of delinquents at 12:15 that\u2019s new to this episode.  Not sure what\u2019s up with that, could just be setting the scene though.</li>\n<li>We get an unnaturally saturated color palette to show the strangeness of the situation this time around.</li>\n<li>CLOCK CLOCK.  (~1:52 A.M.)  Now with another time loop butterfly, that makes three uses so far this episode.</li>\n<li>Yuki sitting hunched on the ground in near-fetal position along with Mikuru is another subtle show of her deteriorating mental state.</li>\n<li>WATCH WATCH.  (Same time I think, also the design represents the loops because of course.)</li>\n<li>MUST\u2026 HUG\u2026 AND\u2026 COMFORT\u2026 YUKI\u2026</li>\n<li>Props to Yuuko Gotou for her rendition of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line here, that was well-acted.</li>\n<li>Oh shit Mikuru is wearing dolphin shorts, isn\u2019t she?  I approve!</li>\n<li>15:23 flashes; again, Japanese film culture has a thing about power lines.</li>\n<li>At a meta level, note the \u201call deja vu is the result of remembering similar events in past lives\u201d reincarnation take.  (Actual Western occultism (not sure about Eastern) doesn\u2019t tend to agree with this, amusingly enough, despite belief in reincarnation also being common there; instead the common theory there goes off the astral plane concept and posits that time does not flow linearly at that level so events in the future can be remembered in the past\u2026 which actually also isn\u2019t that far from our time loop here, come to think of it...)</li>\n<li>Okay Mikuru is also looking extremely huggable at 15:59.</li>\n<li>Hey, Kyon realized who Koizumi was talking about without needing to be told!  (As reinforced by centering Yuki in the middle of the screen here, focusing your attention on her a second before he speaks up.)  And look at Yuki moving her eyes to look at Kyon as he asks about this.</li>\n<li>Yuki blink!</li>\n<li>Holy shit that piano track that fires up after 15,521 works well here.  Sad, emotional, almost tragic, it fits the mood they\u2019re going for perfectly.</li>\n<li>Shit, I almost missed Mikuru being shocked as well.</li>\n<li>More blinks.  Keep an eye on that, it might be a visual representation of Yuki slowly getting more human.</li>\n<li>Hey look, he has a calculator to do the math this time!  (I can actually get close through mental math via shortcuts \u2013 15,498 the original end loop being close to 15,600 which is 600 x 26 (26 two-week periods in a year) exact helps and I did mental math competitions in school back in the day \u2013 but not precisely.)</li>\n<li>And we have FINALLY ticked up to 595 years.</li>\n<li>Milky Way Milky Way!</li>\n<li>HNNGH 18:28 HUG THE YUKI.</li>\n<li>Also a blunt visual separation shot right after at 18:33.</li>\n<li>18:47 because Yuki thinks of herself as an observer (much like that telescope, which might be why she keeps looking through it earlier in addition to looking where it points here) and also a slightly panoramic shot which might be intended to give the impression of an IMAX planetarium.</li>\n<li>Huh, airplane.  (Also Yuki remains infinitely huggable and infinitely in need of hugs or some other kind of emotional support.)</li>\n<li>Huh, we get the observer line during the test of courage this time instead of during baseball.  I actually like that choice, this is in many ways Yuki\u2019s emotional test (far beyond what she ever should have had to handle).</li>\n<li>The thundercloud at 19:55 is more developed than earlier in the episode, which will indicate the gathering metaphorical storm as we approach August 31.</li>\n<li>Another stadium shot at 20:10, again calling back to the game at the beginning.</li>\n<li>Another episode with a sore de and then a sore demo (20:21), wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that\u2019s actually in the original LN.</li>\n<li>The rotating playground thing whose name I forget at 20:29 is another blunt visual metaphor; note the rotation is counterclockwise and Haruhi is pushing it, which is extremely obvious and almost certainly has nothing to do with Great Mandala movements at all in this case.  (Haruhi is after all literally turning the clock back!)</li>\n<li>And I typed that BEFORE they started rotating the world around the nearly stationary playground equipment towards the end of that shot.</li>\n<li>Kyon drawing that infinity-looking eight at 20:42 is the bluntest thing in the world.  \u201cYou have realized we\u2019re doing this for the full eight episodes by this point, right?\u201d</li>\n<li>Okay, Koizumi has best swimsuit this episode but Mikuru wins best casual outfit in a walk, she has like three really good ones this episode including this last one here at 20:51.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqjz82/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670726295.0, "author_flair_text": ":DC::DD::U::I:", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3, "_fetched": true}

(Also I heard crows cawing in the background briefly.)  Another means of representing disorientation, and the first two at least have symbolism relevant to time loops.\n- Kyon only wearing an undershirt here at the start might be a reference [meta spoiler] >!Higurashi is a possibility, though Keiichi\u2019s vest in DEEN form is different!<.\n- Good shadow usage at 00:30.\n- \u201cKyon-kun, denwa.\u201d\n- Facial animation looks better than usual this episode.\n- Okay, that\u2019s the best opening title card yet.  Infinity symbol Endless Eight is on point.\n- Also, Haruhi your fashion sense is off today.  (Koizumi looks average, so Mikuru will take this in a walk.)\n- LOL Kyon holding the inflatable whats-it-called over his shoulder as he goes \u201cwell I suppose that makes sense with these preparations\u201d.  More \u201cno shit\u201d than usual, that\u2019s a straight-up visual gag I think.\n- Kyon is a target today!\n- I really should probably note how each half of each episode after the first is structured so that the first half has Kyon receiving a phone call and then going to this park, just with the time of day inverted.\n- Oh wait, Koizumi has the inflatable instead of Kyon.  (Also Yuki is bored, but count still suspended.)\n- Haruhi\u2019s head in the foreground blocking Mikuru\u2019s face in the background at 03:46 is also an interesting shot choice.  I\u2019d say another \u201cno, don\u2019t look at her, look at me!\u201d but Haruhi\u2019s not really visible either.\n- 04:02: Mikuru is cute!  (Yuki is still bored.)\n- THIS LOOP\u2019S SWIMWEAR: Haruhi: halter-top baby blue bikini with red, yellow, and white hearts on it (props for the design, massive minus points for the colors clashing with her); Mikuru: pastel rainbow bikini/two-piece with a front tie on the top and a skirt on the bottom; Yuki: competition swimsuit; Kyon: long red trunks; Koizumi: medium blue trunks with a white design on them.  I think Mikuru wins this one still, but Yuki actually comes quite close, that competition swimsuit works on her.\n- The quick cuts are in fact this episode\u2019s way of showing disorientation/deja vu.\n- Also LAMP LAMP in the background at the pool, not sure it was visible in any prior episode.\n- Yuki is at least swimming!  Good for her.  (Except\u2026 there might actually be more to it.  Water can symbolize emotions\u2026 and we\u2019ve seen Yuki getting into the water more and more over the course of these episodes, joining the always emotional Haruhi and Mikuru.  Funny that.)\n- Cute Yuki at 05:20.  (The thing about this episode\u2019s Yuki is that she doesn\u2019t look quite as bored as she has in the last three and she probably should be.)\n- Never mind, there we go, bored look back at 05:23.\n- Wait, Mikuru\u2019s swimsuit is another halter-top!  That\u2019ll win her Best Swimsuit today from me.\n- Fanservice ho!\n- Muting out the music as Kyon looks at Yuki\u2019s boredom is a good audio touch.\n- I\u2019ll go ahead and note that Dutch angle at 06:02, the episode is using it as the \u201csomething is wrong\u201d visual cue here.\n- Poor Mikuru.\n- And now we see Mikuru with a heating or cold pad on her face in the restaurant at 06:30; nice touch!\n- Yuki\u2019s never been out of the side chair IIRC for reasons I explained yesterday, but 06:41 draws attention to it well.\n- Exit sign never shows up here either, they know you know it\u2019s not ending this episode.\n- Return of the power lines!\n- Yuki moving left again at 07:28; not the first time we\u2019ve seen her moving to the left (future) as Kyon catches up to check on her.\n- Ooh, THAT\u2019S noteworthy.  Note the tree in front of Yuki at 07:31 when she stops to turn towards Kyon; Kyon is blocking her path to the future.  (Do the fucking homework, Kyon!  Also might have more to say, but I think I\u2019d rather not talk about that until I can admit a point from Disappearance which might be relevant.)  Also note her facial expression; it looks almost irritated as she closes her eyes right before she turns to face him.\n- 07:35 is a visual box shot with slightly different symbolism; Kyon has entered the box (the little trapped loop world) Yuki is in to check up on her.\n- And then the cut at 07:48 means that Yuki\u2019s head *becomes* the tree, interesting.  Might have an idea there, but again I want that Disappearance point in evidence for that.\n- 07:54: HNNNGH MUST HUG THE YUKI.  (She almost looks concerned to me there\u2026 and then right back to looking irritated from the side as we cut back to the box frame.  Also cue the crows.)\n- Haruhi was saving her fashion sense for the yukata I see; the color coordination (same main color, different secondary colors) works perfectly, yukata winner today is all three as a unit because they are more than the sum of their parts.\n- Kyon wearing a sigma T-shirt.  Probably supposed to be a math joke knowing this show (infinite sum), but there\u2019s a meme joke to be made here that couldn\u2019t have been intended since said meme postdates this series by at least half a decade, probably twice that.  (Or I could make an ancient Greece joke, IIRC Spartans were reputed for using shields with a sigma printed on them.)\n- Oh right there\u2019s the other Eva reference, there are subtle Unit-02 and Unit-00 references in the colors of two of the mask types today.\n- Was half-expecting Yuki to go for the Unit-00 mask because obvious Rei expy is obvious, but no it\u2019s another robot mask.  (Same symbolism as it\u2019s had for several episodes now, Yuki\u2019s robotic demeanor is a mask by now.)\n- \u2026 ooookkkaaay, so Mikuru really can rock a ponytail if she wants to.  [](#towel)\n- And in turn an extremely cute Haruhi att 11:14 (that facial expression plus that yukata just works). Also I think she\u2019s bouncing her breasts a bit to appeal to Kyon.\n- PFFFFT Koizumi is wearing a safari park ranger getup for the cicada hunt.  (Meanwhile Mikuru is wearing a farmer\u2019s overalls/shirt/hat.  You know, she could probably try the proverbial sack too, she\u2019d probably rock it just fine.)\n- Dutch angles for the cicada-catching competition montage.  Something is amiss!  (Again.)\n- Ah, more higurashi cries.\n- Huh, fan in the supermarket office is CGI.  Obvious enough this time (12:28).\n- Okay, what mecha is Adzam Leader from?\n- Well, Haruhi\u2019s tank top at 12:35 works on her, at least.\n- Huh.  Mikuru uses \u201catashi\u201d.  Never noticed that before.  Might be a hint that at least some of her moeblobness is an act, actually.\n- \u201cWe\u2019ve entered an endless recursion of time!\u201d\n- The visual separation this time around is really strange, with Koizumi separated consistently from both Kyon and Mikuru.  Possibly because the espers have done the research and neither of them really have?\n- Something about the VA performance and/or animation for Mikuru during this version of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line.  She doesn\u2019t quite manage to land being distraught enough (which is the idea, she\u2019s blabbing without heed and getting filtered by a verbal censor).\n- \u201cWhen the loop starts over, we won\u2019t remember ever having this conversation.\u201d\n- Koizumi and Yuki in the same visual box at 17:02 because they\u2019re the two with better info on the situation, Yuki separated from the other three because she remembers, got it.\n- 18:27: Good shadow usage, also PROTECC THE YUKI.\n- Another Dutch angle for disorientation.\n- Rotating shot at ~19:10 is the flashiest of the episode so far (counterclockwise because literally against the clock).\n- Oof that zoom-out on Yuki at 19:36.\n- You know, this show knows about Sisyphus.  Kyon walking his bike up the road at ~19:53 might be symbolism of the same kind: moving the bike up the hill to try to get past the crest (August 31), but implicitly he does not manage it.\n- Ooh, twinkling stars!\n- This loop Yuki brings a book to the roof, I see.\n- Mikuru still not swinging at baseballs I see\u2026 wait I take that back, she actually does try!  She\u2019s improving!  (Just a little.)  (But does she want to improve at this specifically?  That is the question.)\n- LOL we get Haruhi sleeping on Yuki for a change.\n- Exit sign visible this time at the final restaurant meeting.\n- Does Haruhi manage to snipe best outfits this episode after all?  She\u2019s come on strong late (and Mikuru\u2019s outfits have stagnated).\n\n---\n\n> What's the biggest problem procrastinating on your homework has given you\n\nThere's a couple of classes in college where I just ate a lost point of GPA rather than do the homework.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_izqkjbu", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [{"a": ":DC:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/7natxx00jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DC", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":DD:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/q070d130jx7a1_t5_2qh22/DD", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":U:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/54iq6jbdq3aa1_t5_2qh22/U", "e": "emoji"}, {"a": ":I:", "u": "https://emoji.redditmedia.com/fbcu01wmf65a1_t5_2qh22/I", "e": "emoji"}], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><h3>Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>This episode seems to like quick cuts for effect \u2013 the cicada flash at 00:04, the yield sign (unless Japan didn\u2019t borrow the upside-down-triangle-means-yield convention) at 00:07, the stream at 00:09.

Also cue the crows.)</li>\n<li>Haruhi was saving her fashion sense for the yukata I see; the color coordination (same main color, different secondary colors) works perfectly, yukata winner today is all three as a unit because they are more than the sum of their parts.</li>\n<li>Kyon wearing a sigma T-shirt.  Probably supposed to be a math joke knowing this show (infinite sum), but there\u2019s a meme joke to be made here that couldn\u2019t have been intended since said meme postdates this series by at least half a decade, probably twice that.  (Or I could make an ancient Greece joke, IIRC Spartans were reputed for using shields with a sigma printed on them.)</li>\n<li>Oh right there\u2019s the other Eva reference, there are subtle Unit-02 and Unit-00 references in the colors of two of the mask types today.</li>\n<li>Was half-expecting Yuki to go for the Unit-00 mask because obvious Rei expy is obvious, but no it\u2019s another robot mask.  (Same symbolism as it\u2019s had for several episodes now, Yuki\u2019s robotic demeanor is a mask by now.)</li>\n<li>\u2026 ooookkkaaay, so Mikuru really can rock a ponytail if she wants to.  <a href=\"#towel\"></a></li>\n<li>And in turn an extremely cute Haruhi att 11:14 (that facial expression plus that yukata just works). Also I think she\u2019s bouncing her breasts a bit to appeal to Kyon.</li>\n<li>PFFFFT Koizumi is wearing a safari park ranger getup for the cicada hunt.  (Meanwhile Mikuru is wearing a farmer\u2019s overalls/shirt/hat.  You know, she could probably try the proverbial sack too, she\u2019d probably rock it just fine.)</li>\n<li>Dutch angles for the cicada-catching competition montage.  Something is amiss!  (Again.)</li>\n<li>Ah, more higurashi cries.</li>\n<li>Huh, fan in the supermarket office is CGI.  Obvious enough this time (12:28).</li>\n<li>Okay, what mecha is Adzam Leader from?</li>\n<li>Well, Haruhi\u2019s tank top at 12:35 works on her, at least.</li>\n<li>Huh.  Mikuru uses \u201catashi\u201d.  Never noticed that before.  Might be a hint that at least some of her moeblobness is an act, actually.</li>\n<li>\u201cWe\u2019ve entered an endless recursion of time!\u201d</li>\n<li>The visual separation this time around is really strange, with Koizumi separated consistently from both Kyon and Mikuru.  Possibly because the espers have done the research and neither of them really have?</li>\n<li>Something about the VA performance and/or animation for Mikuru during this version of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line.  She doesn\u2019t quite manage to land being distraught enough (which is the idea, she\u2019s blabbing without heed and getting filtered by a verbal censor).</li>\n<li>\u201cWhen the loop starts over, we won\u2019t remember ever having this conversation.\u201d</li>\n<li>Koizumi and Yuki in the same visual box at 17:02 because they\u2019re the two with better info on the situation, Yuki separated from the other three because she remembers, got it.</li>\n<li>18:27: Good shadow usage, also PROTECC THE YUKI.</li>\n<li>Another Dutch angle for disorientation.</li>\n<li>Rotating shot at ~19:10 is the flashiest of the episode so far (counterclockwise because literally against the clock).</li>\n<li>Oof that zoom-out on Yuki at 19:36.</li>\n<li>You know, this show knows about Sisyphus.  Kyon walking his bike up the road at ~19:53 might be symbolism of the same kind: moving the bike up the hill to try to get past the crest (August 31), but implicitly he does not manage it.</li>\n<li>Ooh, twinkling stars!</li>\n<li>This loop Yuki brings a book to the roof, I see.</li>\n<li>Mikuru still not swinging at baseballs I see\u2026 wait I take that back, she actually does try!  She\u2019s improving!  (Just a little.)  (But does she want to improve at this specifically?  That is the question.)</li>\n<li>LOL we get Haruhi sleeping on Yuki for a change.</li>\n<li>Exit sign visible this time at the final restaurant meeting.</li>\n<li>Does Haruhi manage to snipe best outfits this episode after all?  She\u2019s come on strong late (and Mikuru\u2019s outfits have stagnated).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What&#39;s the biggest problem procrastinating on your homework has given you</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s a couple of classes in college where I just ate a lost point of GPA rather than do the homework.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkjbu/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670726581.0, "author_flair_text": ":DC::DD::U::I:", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4, "_fetched": true}

Also, nice August 8 start there, and nice use of the tape dispenser to represent the loop at 00:08.  Also the Rule of Three repetition of \u201cstrange\u201d (\u201cokashi\u201d) before starting up the usual opening line (\u201csomething was strange\u201d).  It\u2019s like a film projector or a record player skipping\u2026 which is probably another part of the tape dispenser shot, too.\n- The OST for this scene works very well to set the mood, too.\n- Oh right, the stuttering is also just visual/audio representation of deja vu.  Duh.\n- \u201cKyon-kun, denwa.\u201d\n- Also nice use of shadows with the light from the TV screen shining over the unnaturally dark room (also mirrors E8-2 in a way, but not in others).  It\u2019s like the TV screen is the only source of light on the situation \u2013 which might be meta, the events on screen are the only light at the end of the tunnel that was the E8 fan experience.\n- There might be deeper meaning to the couch shot around 01:25\u2026 separation since Imouto doesn\u2019t remember anything and is just blindly watching events new to her while Kyon has faint past memories? Hmm, with the TV here might be a meta angle \u2013 oh right, we the viewer are via the POV further removed from the TV (the surface image of the world) than either Imouto or Kyon, since we remember everything.  (And then there\u2019s Yuki watching the TV from a lightyear behind us\u2026)\n- Aww the title is just a small ring this time.\n- You wouldn\u2019t think Haruhi\u2019s outfit here would work on her, but it does.  (A bit hot though I would think.)  Also give me a better shot of Mikuru\u2019s outfit please, I can\u2019t make it out well enough to judge it.  (Kyon has no style sense, Koizumi probably does but not one that meshes with me.)\n- Cut to Haruhi looking straight at the camera as she talks about how this is their only freshman high school vacation.  They knew exactly what they were doing there and I love it.\n- Mikuru\u2019s outfit is the inverse of Haruhi\u2019s and doesn\u2019t work quite as well as you would think\u2026 leaving them roughly on par.  Also bored Yuki is bored, but what\u2019s new?\n- The cicadas are crying so loudly!  (Now if I could only make out what kind.  They almost sound like higurashi/evening cicadas despite calling in the middle of the day.)\n- 04:21: PFFT.  Sometimes you just gotta go for the in-your-face fanservice, you know?\n- THIS LOOP\u2019S SWIMWEAR: magenta halterneck bikini for Haruhi, halterneck white and coral bikini or two-piece with frilly skirt for Mikuru (incredibly cute, especially since the coral matches her hair, probably wins her best swimsuit for the loop despite Haruhi\u2019s best efforts, though I don\u2019t actually like the red bow on the front), teal one-piece (competition swimsuit again?) for Yuki, army green mid-length swim trunks with two vertical yellow stripes for Koizumi, navy blue short trunks for Kyon.\n- Haruhi a cute.  Yuki a bored\u2026 and also a cute.  Koizumi a smiler.\n- Keep audience interest: show Gainaxing!  Also, we get the mole at 05:30.\n- LOL our very bored Yuki just floating along to the left matching the speed of everyone running in the background at 05:33\u2026 wait a minute.  That might not just be for humor, that might have a point.  Yuki is putting no effort in (since she considers herself an observer) but is still moving forward in the loops at the same speed as everyone else.\n- Oh god the ever more bored Yuki face, now with hidden eyes at 05:57.  Must\u2026 offer\u2026 hug\u2026\n- More deja vu shown on screen, and then we go to black and white this time to show Kyon noticing it.\n- Yet more crows cawing at midday.\n- Oh.  THAT\u2019S new.  *Yuki is no longer sitting at the side seat when the club meets up for the first time in this loop.*  Instead she is seated by Haruhi and Kyon instead has the side seat.  I\u2019ll bet I know what\u2019s up with that; [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION].\n- Yuki blink at 06:57.\n- Also note the occulted exit sign (the man is blocked by the structural element in the foreground) in this scene.\n- Ooh, might want to pay attention to 07:35 where Yuki goes to take a sip of her drink, notices Kyon looking at her, and stops.\n- Well well well.  We get a table change-up, and now we get Yuki leaving to the right, not the left.\n- For the second episode in a row we get an annoyed Yuki look as Kyon catches up.  (\u2026 And now that I think about it I can think of a VERY direct comparison in another time loop anime, though it\u2019s in a hallway there [meta spoiler] >!PMMM 1 to be precise!<.)\n- Also yet another visual barrier for separation.\n- Given Japanese cinematographic left-right symbolism 08:24 probably symbolizes \u201cgo this way to get to the future\u201d\u2026 oh wait no, it\u2019s also counterclockwise so just the loop, never mind.\n- Swap that red shirt at 08:40 for a red vest and Kyon would be wearing a certain Keiichi\u2019s DEEN outfit, heh. Also Haruhi and Mikuru both brought adorable outfits.\n- Bulk ladies\u2019 store called Endless.  OF COURSE THEY DID.\n- Me, a moment later: \u201cBut I know KyoAni, we have the Endless, where\u2019s the eight?\u2026 oh, how stupid of me, each shelf has eight piles of clothes for sale on it.  Hurr durr.\u201d\n- Oh shit they upped last episode\u2019s yukatas.  I don\u2019t know how to choose they all look great!  (Haruhi is probably actually the weakest which is saying something, would omochikaeri any of them in those in any event.)\n- HNNGH smiling Mikuru with hair up in yukata is adorable HNNNGH.\n- Is\u2026 is Koizumi wearing a ninja outfit to the O-bon festival?\n- Alien mask for Yuki this loop.  (Frowning alien mask too, sounds about right.)\n- 10:51: \u201cSo anyways I started blasting.\u201d  (Also I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s a reference.  That\u2019s not the Heavyarms pose again, is it?)\n- The sparklers at 10:57 are looping in the shape of infinity symbols, heh.  (Also the most bored look on Yuki\u2019s face yet.)\n- LOL Kyon goes \u201cthree days\u201d in English this time!\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- LOL Kyon ogling the Mikuru at 11:43 ~~I\u2019m not one to talk, guess why my eyes wandered over to where I noticed his~~.\n- LOL Mikuru wearing a Robin Hood hat along with a (denim?) skirt, white sleeveless shirt, and black tights (are they still tights when they don\u2019t go all the way down?  I forget) is something I didn\u2019t know I needed until I got it.  Also Haruhi wearing a sportsman\u2019s vest.  (And Kyon is giving some random /a/non what they want\u2026 and if you told me someone on KyoAni actually went on the Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy to see reactions there I would not really be that surprised.)\n- Today, Yuki catches a grasshopper!\n- Desaturation in the supermarket backroom.  Also Yuki is bored and Haruhi\u2019s casual outfit looks good (but I think Mikuru has Best Outfits This Episode on lockdown at this point).\n- Kyon\u2019s \u201cyou bastard, you bastard\u201d at 14:11 twinges my \u201cthis might be a reference to something I am unfamiliar with\u201d sense.\n- Very different visual barrier this time at 14:18, with Kyon in the box separated from the other three. He\u2019s yet to be filled in on the loop?\n- HNNNGH Mikuru protecc time.\n- \u201cWe\u2019ve entered an endless recursion of time.\u201d\n- (Also note all four in the same visual box at 14:36.)\n- Cut to Koizumi\u2019s watch to emphasize that the flow of time has become strange, not new, still worth noting.\n- The extremely repetitive OST here (especially in its beat) is another good use of OST to contribute to mood.\n- Shadow cutting across the door at 15:56 to visually emphasize the section of time that has been cut out?\n- Cut to trashcans, one lid ajar, one closed.  That\u2019s unlikely to be a coincidence.  Representing the overwritten memories but one is ajar because some of said memories kind of escape for those closest to Haruhi?  Would fit with the show\u2019s usual visual reinforcement of words.\n- Another Yuki with hidden eyes at 16:14.  Also yet another visual barrier/separation shot.\n- And we keep the pillar in the same relative place for the visual barrier/separation when cutting to show all of them, not unsurprising but a very strong indicator this was intentional since they do it twice in short order.\n- Cut to a melted discarded popsicle and wrapper for it at 16:52.  Ohh that\u2019s for Yuki isn\u2019t it \u2013 the ice queen of sorts is melting!  (Water can represent emotions, remember, and the man on the wrapper has a body type that looks rather like the classic Little Green Man \u2013 and Yuki was wearing a mask of that kind of alien\u2019s face at the festival.)\n- Pillar plus cuts also give us visual separation between Koizumi and Kyon, not for the first time this scene this arc.\n- PFFT blatant visual answer cut at 17:58.  But also note: Yuki has moved over to Kyon\u2019s side of the visual barrier\u2026\n- This has the best OST use of 2009 so far, and it\u2019s not close.  (The track that fires up after Yuki drops the 15,527th loop reveal also reminds me quite strongly of a Higurashi anime OST track at their respective starts, actually \u2013 Onigaen is the Higurashi track in question I think.  Later parts kind of do too, Onigaen is chime-heavy.)\n- Extremely noticeable Dutch angle at 18:33.  Also note that Yuki\u2019s eyes are hidden in shadow yet again in that shot.\n- Shadow usage at 18:56 might actually merit the \u201cdownright brilliant\u201d descriptor, especially with how it frames Yuki\u2019s eyes and shadows one of them and how it makes Kyon\u2019s fingers look almost like claws.\n- Sad Mikuru is sad.\n- The Japanese thing about power lines strikes again at 19:32, though to what end I still don\u2019t know.\n- Shimmering-Sky gets her shimmering sky.

Also yet another visual barrier/separation shot.</li>\n<li>And we keep the pillar in the same relative place for the visual barrier/separation when cutting to show all of them, not unsurprising but a very strong indicator this was intentional since they do it twice in short order.</li>\n<li>Cut to a melted discarded popsicle and wrapper for it at 16:52.  Ohh that\u2019s for Yuki isn\u2019t it \u2013 the ice queen of sorts is melting!  (Water can represent emotions, remember, and the man on the wrapper has a body type that looks rather like the classic Little Green Man \u2013 and Yuki was wearing a mask of that kind of alien\u2019s face at the festival.)</li>\n<li>Pillar plus cuts also give us visual separation between Koizumi and Kyon, not for the first time this scene this arc.</li>\n<li>PFFT blatant visual answer cut at 17:58.  But also note: Yuki has moved over to Kyon\u2019s side of the visual barrier\u2026</li>\n<li>This has the best OST use of 2009 so far, and it\u2019s not close.  (The track that fires up after Yuki drops the 15,527th loop reveal also reminds me quite strongly of a Higurashi anime OST track at their respective starts, actually \u2013 Onigaen is the Higurashi track in question I think.  Later parts kind of do too, Onigaen is chime-heavy.)</li>\n<li>Extremely noticeable Dutch angle at 18:33.  Also note that Yuki\u2019s eyes are hidden in shadow yet again in that shot.</li>\n<li>Shadow usage at 18:56 might actually merit the \u201cdownright brilliant\u201d descriptor, especially with how it frames Yuki\u2019s eyes and shadows one of them and how it makes Kyon\u2019s fingers look almost like claws.</li>\n<li>Sad Mikuru is sad.</li>\n<li>The Japanese thing about power lines strikes again at 19:32, though to what end I still don\u2019t know.</li>\n<li>Shimmering-Sky gets her shimmering sky.  Also, huddled Mikuru.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkzkm/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670726812.0, "author_flair_text": ":DC::DD::U::I:", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 4, "_fetched": true}

Also, there are still loops where they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re looping which must totally suck for Nagato knowing that those loops are dead in the water.</span> </p>\n\n<p>[ (2) Haruhi LN] <span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">A few things I\u2019ll also add is there\u2019s a fun moment between the yukatas and the festival where Haruhi does Mikuru and Nagato\u2019s hair at the park in front of the station (same location as the revelation scene). Also, when they go to the batting cages, apparently Haruhi uses the beat up bat that she swiped from the baseball team. In the anime we know that that bat was given to the Kamigahara Pirates! And finally, there\u2019s a bit more content with the homework scene like how Haruhi tells Kyon not to copy her homework word for word and Haruhi helping Mikuru with her essay even though Mikuru is a junior.</span></p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "light", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq11t6/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670716872.0, "author_flair_text": ":DE::DF::M:https://myanimelist.net/profile/delicruise", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi7vno", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "#2e51a2", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7, "_fetched": true}

At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.\n\nIt's not actually that difficult a calculation to do in your head. There's 52 (and some change) weeks in a year, so since the loop is two weeks, divide the loops by 26 to get the total time in years. Since dividing by 26 is a pain, instead divide by 25, which is much easier.\n\nSince division is distributive, break it into components: `10,000 / 25`, Four 25s is 100, 10k is one-hundred 100s, so 400 loops. Half that again accounts for `5,000 / 25`. Repeat for the smaller numbers. Then correct for the difference between 25 and 26 in the divisor. 1/25th is 4% and it's a large enough divisor that the reciprocal is very close. So move the decimal place over twice and multiply by four, then subtract that from the value you got before, and you get the number in years.\n\n```\n15,532 loops = (10,000 / 25 + 5,000 / 25 + 500 / 25 + 30 / 25 + 2 / 25) - 4%\n== (400 + 200 + 20 + 1.2 + 0.08) - 4%\n== (621.28) - (6.2128 * 4)\n== 621.28 - 24.8512\n== 596.4288\n```\n\nYou can simplify it a bit further by dropping some of the decimals if you want, or increase accuracy by carrying them over. The above example is primarily demonstrative of a way you could do it. I didn't double check how precise Kyon gets, but it's easy to get it all the way to exact if you're willing to start with the correct factor of 365.24 days per year, or `365.24 / 7 = 52.177` weeks per year.\n\nI know from working with foreign researchers that the Japanese education system emphasizes confidence in mental arithmetic skills _much_ more than the US education system does. I can do it in my head, though it might take me a minute or two, and I'll have an easier time if I can talk out loud and/or use paper.

There are a lot of trolls, and \"people\" looking for a fight on Reddit.  \n\nTo answer your question, in the US when I went to school there were 2 systems of grading school work.\n\nThe most common one is assigning letters \n\n* A - Excellent, well above average\n\n* B - Above average\n\n* C - Average\n\n* D - Poor, below average\n\n* F -  Failure\n\nIdeally schools the grades in a class should form a Bell Curve centered on C, in reality the grade distribution is a Bell Curve centered between A & B, with almost no F values.  This is done for political reasons, and results in High School Graduates who are illiterate.  (This is a huge political problem in the US that flares up with both sides pointing at each other).\n\nIn my statement, I was speaking of college.  I went to a real Engineering University and the average GPA was around 2.5.  (GPA is calculated by converting a letter grade into digits A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, and F-0.  I went to college a long time ago.  In most modern Universities the average GPA is well above 3 nowadays, and this is also due to political problems.  (Note:  It does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there are real Engineers who only skated their way through engineering school.  One may note how stupid our politicians and billionaires tend to be.

There are a lot of trolls, and &quot;people&quot; looking for a fight on Reddit.  </p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, in the US when I went to school there were 2 systems of grading school work.</p>\n\n<p>The most common one is assigning letters </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>A - Excellent, well above average</p></li>\n<li><p>B - Above average</p></li>\n<li><p>C - Average</p></li>\n<li><p>D - Poor, below average</p></li>\n<li><p>F -  Failure</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Ideally schools the grades in a class should form a Bell Curve centered on C, in reality the grade distribution is a Bell Curve centered between A &amp; B, with almost no F values.  This is done for political reasons, and results in High School Graduates who are illiterate.  (This is a huge political problem in the US that flares up with both sides pointing at each other).</p>\n\n<p>In my statement, I was speaking of college.  I went to a real Engineering University and the average GPA was around 2.5.  (GPA is calculated by converting a letter grade into digits A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, and F-0.  I went to college a long time ago.  In most modern Universities the average GPA is well above 3 nowadays, and this is also due to political problems.  (Note:  It does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there are real Engineers who only skated their way through engineering school.  One may note how stupid our politicians and billionaires tend to be.  Most of them have advanced degrees, which really speaks to the value of a higher degree from an American University where no one fails.

But you already did that, and it ended up being completely useless. How about instead you go back and try to recover parts of Gigil's or Valgo's bodies, to maybe learn what they are made of and how you can kill them? They might be hard to find in the rubble from the destroyed planet, but not impossible with future tech, I'm sure. [](#hardthink)\n\n* It's true that he warmed up to the military lately, but still, Basara actually going with this plan is so out of character for him. \n\n* Irreversible action? Is Gabil gonna transform into kaiju or something?\n\n* Wait, we're in a battle? [](#kotourashock) That was abrupt. \n\n* Wait, no. This is some kind of simulation. \n\n* Wait, wait, wait. So Rey and Veffidas *can* produce sound blasts? [](#haaaaaaah) This is literally the first time we're seeing this. Why they never did it in battle? It was literally never brought up before. And now they are casually doing it. What the fuck, show?\n\n* So, the issue is that Basara is too strong and cannot be contained? Understandable.\n\n* Gamling stepping from behind the three like a stalker was weird. Not sure why they made the scene like that.\n\n* Basara has become addicted to space. \n\n* Veffidas eyecatch! [](#rengehype)\n\n* I don't understand how this sound cage works from the geometry standpoint. The visual doesn't make much sense, but I guess, it works somehow. [](#nyanpasu)\n\n* Is that the record for how fast Gabil lost his mech?\n\n* What? Fusion? [](#jawdrop)\n\n* Noo, not like this. [](#frustration) Why didn't you two do some kind of fusion pose, you had such a golden opportunity!\n\n* Wait, why are you thinking that Macross Cannon would work on this thing? You saw what it takes to kill a Protodeviln, you basically need an energy amount, capable of ripping apart a planet. I'm pretty sure, a single Macross Cannon is not even close to being that powerful. If you had 10 Macross ships all shooting together, than maybe we could talk about it, but this will just do nothing.\n\n* Yup, like I said, it did nothing. [](#indexsmugshrug)\n\n* Mylene, don't just watch while Basara is getting killed, start singing.\n\n* It's Sivil! [](#SPORTS)\n\n* Well, this should've been a hype moment, but it was severely gimped by sub-par art and directing. \n\n* Wait, they split again? But I though it was irreversible? [](#bigshock)\n\n* So, Sivil used a bunch of Spiritia to shield Basara, and now she's on the run again? Makes sense.\n\n* Abrupt ending, as always. \n\n**Overall thoughts:** I swear to god, this director just cannot direct action scenes. He makes them anti-fun. After this show, he shouldn't be legally allowed to come near action anime ever again, I'm personally willing to file a restraining order against him.\n\nAnd yes, I realize that there are multiple directors working on the show. In my eyes, it just means that they all have failed spectacularly and should retire from action shows and only direct horny fansevice romcoms from now on. How can you take a story like this and make the action so un-fun? You have a fusion, and it doesn't even have animation. A resulting creature also is barely animated. You have a beam battle, but it is drawn in such a way, that it's hard to even see what is happening. A big fun of beam battles is the tug-of-war between two beams, and instead of that, we got [this cut](https://i.imgur.com/ODU8ErD.jpg), which is just horrendous compositionaly, and has like two frames of animation. And then, there was a capture situation, which was just Grabil standing still with some bland special effects around him. And don't even get me started on the Macross Cannon shot. It comes out of nowhere, with zero buildup, no transformation sequence, no nothing. You just immediately know that it's gonna fail. That's not how you should treat Macross Cannon, it deserves more respect.\n \nOutside of the bad action, this episode was alright. I still think that Basara was too easily convinced to go with the plan, but it's not a huge deal.
