Holofan4life here happy to participate in yet another Toradora rewatch thread.\n\nToradora is my favorite anime of all time. As such, I know the series like the back of my hand. I\u2019m going to analyze each episode BEFORE I actually watch the episode. And then after I watch it, I will give my real time thoughts on the episode. But I won\u2019t be analyzing the episode as a whole. You fine folk do such a good job with that already. I will be analyzing a certain character from each episode and give some thoughts on what\u2019s going on in their head. I thought that would be something different and fun.\n\nAlso, I am bringing back the ranking of the episodes. It\u2019s been such a while since I last done it, I figure why not do it again.\n\nWith that out of the way, let\u2019s begin.\n\nCome on. You know. You know who I\u2019ll be analyzing today. It\u2019s all about the Ami, baby.\n\nAmi is to Toradora what Valerie is to 90210. She makes a great show even better just by her presence. Toradora would be your run-of-the-mill romcom, except Ami lit the match and set that whole idea on fire.\n\nI\u2019m gonna have a fun time analyzing Ami because you can tell she\u2019s not really about making friends. She\u2019s all about getting people to idolize her and worship the ground she walks on. Ami is like all the worst attributes of Taiga that Taiga\u2019s classmates speculate her having. Once again, proving you should never judge a book by its cover.\n\nI of course really like the beginning scene where Ami is trying her damndest to act like the sweet innocent girl next door. And the scary thing is, it\u2019s actually believable. Anime has had a long line of ditzy, foggy minded characters, especially when it comes to harem/romance anime. So when Toradora introduces a seemingly ditzy character, that\u2019s what you\u2019re expecting, as we already have a genki character as well as a tsundere. But as soon as Ryuuji leaves the table, she becomes an entirely different person.\n\nSee, she doesn\u2019t mind showing her true colors around Taiga. That\u2019s because she\u2019s not trying to impress Taiga. She\u2019s trying to impress Ryuuji. Ami knows if she keeps up with the charade, she\u2019ll probably have her wrapped around her little finger. Because there\u2019s nothing more perfect than a hot girl that\u2019s attainable.\n\nAnd then of course in the classroom scene, Ami is like a kid in a candy store. She\u2019s like a dog being in a room with a 100 mailman. They\u2019re practically falling over each other praising Ami because they know she\u2019s the model girl, and they want to hang out with her. And she relishes in it because she loves to be popular. I think with the scene with Taiga and Ami sitting alone in the booth, Ami I feel like can tell she can\u2019t pull the wool over her eyes. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t even try. But with the other classmates, they are so enamored with her because they know her as that girl on TV that it\u2019s easy to not show her true colors. They\u2019re ripe for the picking.\n\nAnd then finally, with the scene where Ami lies to Taiga about Kitamura, this is her trying to state her dominance. She sees Taiga as a threat and someone who could possibly expose her, so she does what she can to pick at her? Does she honestly care about hurting her feelings? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think Ami knows Taiga enough to harbor a grudge. But just like a shark who smells blood in the water, she makes sure to try and tackle one of Taiga\u2019s weak points to show how superior she is.\n\nThe genius of Ami as a character is that she helps evolve the other characters. That\u2019s later on her purpose, which we\u2019ll get to. The other genius of Ami is that by comparison, she makes Taiga far more likable. Compared to Ami, Taiga is like a saint. Ami makes Taiga seem like Minori. The show makes the conscious decision of having a character who\u2019s nastier than Taiga so that you can have someone you can root against when they butt heads with her, and it just works so well.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the scene with the vending machines. While I think Ami is still trying to put on the ditzy act to win over Ryuuji, that scene is the one part of the episode involving her where I feel the true her really comes out. Yes, she is still doing the act. And yes, you could argue her blunt attitude in the booth scene with Taiga is her true personality. But I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in what Ami is saying about a lot of girls hating her making her stronger.\n\nAmi comes from the world of modeling. It\u2019s a very cutthroat business, with people always gunning for the top by any means necessary. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Ami created this alternate persona so that she can deceive others and make sure she ended up at the top. To extend on this theory, maybe Ami felt she had no other choice but to create the fake personality so that she\u2019s less prone to getting hurt. Kinda similar to Taiga seemingly driving people away by her violent antics so that she doesn\u2019t get hurt. Maybe in actuality, Taiga and Ami have more in common than they realize.\nJust some food for thought.\n\n**Post episode discussion**\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great episode, and in my opinion probably the second most important episode in the entire series. It really sets up a lot of themes that will be prevalent throughout the rest of the show, in particular being something you\u2019re not. We already got that theme a bit with Ryuuji and Taiga not being as awful as their reputation suggests, but Ami takes it to another level by intentionally being something she\u2019s not. This sets the tone for characters wearing masks, which we also saw a bit with Minori in episode 3.\n\nBecause the character I analyzed was Ami, there\u2019s not much else to say about this episode. It is really ultimately about Ami and not really anyone else. Couple things I want to note are I think it\u2019s adorable to see Taiga actually try to help Ryuuji out around the house more. It shows how much she wants to play an active role in Ryuuji\u2019s life. Second, when Taiga slapped Ami across the face, if you look carefully, there actually was a fly. She wasn\u2019t joking. Third, I guess Kitamura\u2019s friendship with Ami set him to fall in love with Taiga. He must love aggressive girls. But if that\u2019s the case, why didn\u2019t he fall in love with Ami? My theory is Kitamura wants to end up with the real deal rather than someone who\u2019s disingenuous. Kitamura tolerates Ami because he knows deep down inside lies probably a good person, but he doesn\u2019t want to be with someone who\u2019s always putting on an act.\n\nOne last thing I want to make note of that I didn\u2019t pick up on in my previous rewatches is the sound design is exquisite. It really helps make jokes land. Taiga shoving the magazine in Ryuuji\u2019s face, Taiga turning Ryuuji\u2019s head, the sound of Ryuuji\u2019s neck cracking as he turns his head back around, the sound design adds a level of humor to the show that the show would be missing without it. It\u2019s really stellar stuff.\n\n**Episode Rankings**\n\n1. Episode 2\n2. **Episode 5**\n3. Episode 4\n4. Episode 1\n5.

Ami knows if she keeps up with the charade, she\u2019ll probably have her wrapped around her little finger. Because there\u2019s nothing more perfect than a hot girl that\u2019s attainable.</p>\n\n<p>And then of course in the classroom scene, Ami is like a kid in a candy store. She\u2019s like a dog being in a room with a 100 mailman. They\u2019re practically falling over each other praising Ami because they know she\u2019s the model girl, and they want to hang out with her. And she relishes in it because she loves to be popular. I think with the scene with Taiga and Ami sitting alone in the booth, Ami I feel like can tell she can\u2019t pull the wool over her eyes. That\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t even try. But with the other classmates, they are so enamored with her because they know her as that girl on TV that it\u2019s easy to not show her true colors. They\u2019re ripe for the picking.</p>\n\n<p>And then finally, with the scene where Ami lies to Taiga about Kitamura, this is her trying to state her dominance. She sees Taiga as a threat and someone who could possibly expose her, so she does what she can to pick at her? Does she honestly care about hurting her feelings? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think Ami knows Taiga enough to harbor a grudge. But just like a shark who smells blood in the water, she makes sure to try and tackle one of Taiga\u2019s weak points to show how superior she is.</p>\n\n<p>The genius of Ami as a character is that she helps evolve the other characters. That\u2019s later on her purpose, which we\u2019ll get to. The other genius of Ami is that by comparison, she makes Taiga far more likable. Compared to Ami, Taiga is like a saint. Ami makes Taiga seem like Minori. The show makes the conscious decision of having a character who\u2019s nastier than Taiga so that you can have someone you can root against when they butt heads with her, and it just works so well.</p>\n\n<p>The last thing I want to touch on is the scene with the vending machines. While I think Ami is still trying to put on the ditzy act to win over Ryuuji, that scene is the one part of the episode involving her where I feel the true her really comes out. Yes, she is still doing the act. And yes, you could argue her blunt attitude in the booth scene with Taiga is her true personality. But I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in what Ami is saying about a lot of girls hating her making her stronger.</p>\n\n<p>Ami comes from the world of modeling. It\u2019s a very cutthroat business, with people always gunning for the top by any means necessary. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Ami created this alternate persona so that she can deceive others and make sure she ended up at the top. To extend on this theory, maybe Ami felt she had no other choice but to create the fake personality so that she\u2019s less prone to getting hurt. Kinda similar to Taiga seemingly driving people away by her violent antics so that she doesn\u2019t get hurt. Maybe in actuality, Taiga and Ami have more in common than they realize.\nJust some food for thought.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Post episode discussion</strong></p>\n\n<p>Overall, this is a pretty great episode, and in my opinion probably the second most important episode in the entire series. It really sets up a lot of themes that will be prevalent throughout the rest of the show, in particular being something you\u2019re not. We already got that theme a bit with Ryuuji and Taiga not being as awful as their reputation suggests, but Ami takes it to another level by intentionally being something she\u2019s not. This sets the tone for characters wearing masks, which we also saw a bit with Minori in episode 3.</p>\n\n<p>Because the character I analyzed was Ami, there\u2019s not much else to say about this episode. It is really ultimately about Ami and not really anyone else. Couple things I want to note are I think it\u2019s adorable to see Taiga actually try to help Ryuuji out around the house more. It shows how much she wants to play an active role in Ryuuji\u2019s life. Second, when Taiga slapped Ami across the face, if you look carefully, there actually was a fly. She wasn\u2019t joking. Third, I guess Kitamura\u2019s friendship with Ami set him to fall in love with Taiga. He must love aggressive girls. But if that\u2019s the case, why didn\u2019t he fall in love with Ami? My theory is Kitamura wants to end up with the real deal rather than someone who\u2019s disingenuous. Kitamura tolerates Ami because he knows deep down inside lies probably a good person, but he doesn\u2019t want to be with someone who\u2019s always putting on an act.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing I want to make note of that I didn\u2019t pick up on in my previous rewatches is the sound design is exquisite. It really helps make jokes land. Taiga shoving the magazine in Ryuuji\u2019s face, Taiga turning Ryuuji\u2019s head, the sound of Ryuuji\u2019s neck cracking as he turns his head back around, the sound design adds a level of humor to the show that the show would be missing without it. It\u2019s really stellar stuff.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Episode Rankings</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Episode 2</li>\n<li><strong>Episode 5</strong></li>\n<li>Episode 4</li>\n<li>Episode 1</li>\n<li>Episode 3</li>\n</ol>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpcf22/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670705922.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi3c0e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 14, "_fetched": true}

Her nest is on the couch in her living room instead of on the bed.\n\n>There was a moment of hesitation. But Ryuuji made up his mind and flipped over the top of the couch. Ryuuji held his knees and sat down beside Taiga, who was hiding in her nest like a baby cub.\n\nTaiga talks about her insecurities a bit comparing herself to Ami and then\n\n>she had a cooling patch stuck on her round forehead. She might have developed a bump. Ryuuji felt a sting in his heart, and mostly subconsciously, gently rubbed the patch. Taiga didn\u2019t push his hand away.\n\nFinally, the incident where they catch Ami with all of the junk food. They see her before she goes into the convenience store and watch her stacking a basket. Even the clerk is staring at her amused.\n\nAnd here are some choice moments I highlighted while I was reading.\n\n>Taiga\u2019s swaying, waist-length hair was softly tangled, the color of chestnut touched by smoke. Her delicate body was enveloped in a fluffy dress piled with lace. Paired with her figure, Ryuuji thought the unbleached overskirt left her with an elegantly volumized and cute\u2014 (interrupted by Taiga yelling at him lol)\n\n>Although Taiga wasn\u2019t living with them, on their days off, they were together during the day. They were together at night. They were together while shopping. They had an unwritten rule that she wouldn\u2019t stay overnight, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for them to doze off after dinner and keep each other company late into the night. They were pretty much living together, but they weren\u2019t involved, not as a couple, anyway. But as Taiga stood up, Ryuuji dawdled, lingering behind her.\n\n>It might\u2019ve had something to do with the accidental way he found out about how brave Taiga really was, or how she was pretty much an underdog, but he felt like he\u2019d pick Taiga\u2019s personality over Ami\u2019s every time.\n\n>This definitely wasn\u2019t him throwing away a chance at a girlfriend in order to take care of Taiga\u2014definitely not. He was just cleaning up something that Taiga had made a mess of. Taiga had made an unbelievable blunder, and he was just picking up the pieces\u2014that was it. He just wanted to be by her every day so that he could instantly cover for her.

They see her before she goes into the convenience store and watch her stacking a basket. Even the clerk is staring at her amused.</p>\n\n<p>And here are some choice moments I highlighted while I was reading.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Taiga\u2019s swaying, waist-length hair was softly tangled, the color of chestnut touched by smoke. Her delicate body was enveloped in a fluffy dress piled with lace. Paired with her figure, Ryuuji thought the unbleached overskirt left her with an elegantly volumized and cute\u2014 (interrupted by Taiga yelling at him lol)</p>\n\n<p>Although Taiga wasn\u2019t living with them, on their days off, they were together during the day. They were together at night. They were together while shopping. They had an unwritten rule that she wouldn\u2019t stay overnight, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for them to doze off after dinner and keep each other company late into the night. They were pretty much living together, but they weren\u2019t involved, not as a couple, anyway. But as Taiga stood up, Ryuuji dawdled, lingering behind her.</p>\n\n<p>It might\u2019ve had something to do with the accidental way he found out about how brave Taiga really was, or how she was pretty much an underdog, but he felt like he\u2019d pick Taiga\u2019s personality over Ami\u2019s every time.</p>\n\n<p>This definitely wasn\u2019t him throwing away a chance at a girlfriend in order to take care of Taiga\u2014definitely not. He was just cleaning up something that Taiga had made a mess of. Taiga had made an unbelievable blunder, and he was just picking up the pieces\u2014that was it. He just wanted to be by her every day so that he could instantly cover for her. So Noto was wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": true, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpdm3u/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670706386.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi3c0e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 8, "_fetched": true}

I'm not really a fan of Ami, her personality does its job in getting on my nerves and it's definitely on full display here. I'm really glad we didn't have to spend a whole episode just to dramatically discover her true nature like some other shows.\n\nOther observations I made:\n\n- I really appreciate the snark Ryuji showed Taiga this episode.

That makes everything a lot easier :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ami episode\n\nWe start of at golden week, which gives us a very good indication how much time has passed.\n\nSchoolyears in Japan start on April 1st, and Goldenweek is around the end of April and beginning of May.\n\nSo about a month has passed between EP 1 and EP5.\n\nI'm not going into translating the TV or the advertisment, either because it's irrelevant dribble or I'm not entirely sure what they are trying to tell us. I'm still learning Japanese, so I'm not able to explain more difficult concepts.\n\nAnyway, the ad foreshadows Amis introduction, as will Taiga reading the catalogue in the caf\u00e9, right before Ami enteres.\n\nAnd I have to say the cartoony \"moving the head and spitting out at the same time\" also happened in the novel.\n\nTakemiya sensei didn't take her work tooo seriously.\n\nAmi calls herself \"Ami-chan\". There is really not a more anime-style way of talking about yourself. She reaaaly thinks she is hot stuff, or she wouldn't adress herself this way.\n\nThis whole scene is of course meant to introduce the 2 sides of Ami, which might look petty now, but has a reasonable foundation behind it, as we will see later.\n\nI don't remember if this is just an artifact of the german dub, but Ami also claims that this town is pretty boring. I think this is somewhat important as the anime takes inspirational shots from Tokyo wards, so you might think we are in the Tokyou-to area.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case if she claims that. The outer burrows of Tokyou-to can be sparse, but it's still not that far into the more interesting districts like Shibuya or Shinjuku.\n\n**\u5927\u6a4b,** which means \"Big Bridge\", the town the story takes place in, is IMO located somewhere in the Kanto region, but not in Tokyou-to.\n\nI'll explain later why I think this is, besides the fact that Ami is bored about the small town she is in right now.\n\nThe title of this episode is just \"Kawashima Ami\" in all-kana, so there is no point in analyzing this.\n\nAmis Kanji are quite straight forward:\n\n**\u5ddd\u5d8b\u3000\u4e9c\u7f8e**, with Kanji for \"river\", \"island\", \"Asia, next\" and \"beautiful\". The island kanji is a name-kanji variant, but it's still easy enough to recognize how it should be pronounced. The fact that both Taiga and Ami have \"river\" in their full names, even with different variants, might be an indication that they are not as different as it looks.\n\nI think it's quite interesting how she trys to lure Ryuuji back into a good standing with her. She is quite skilled with it, not gonna lie, this should usually work. The treat with the coffe, the little apology, the taking him by the hand, creating physical contact etc. This is quite the skillfull, and very feminine, way of luring someone onto ones side. If it wasn't for Kitamura telling him what's going on, I think Ryuuji would have been in the dark a bit longer.\n\nBut since Taiga is very special to him (I don't know if anything about Ryuujis past was already discussed, so I refrain from spoiling the reason why Taiga is special to him), this wouldn't have lasted anyway. Taiga is not a liar. Quite the opposite, it's her inabilty to put on a fake smile like Ami which brings her so much sadness.\n\nOnto Minorins letter: LOL for her using the word \"Transferstudent-chan\"   \n\\-> **\u8ee2\u6821\u751f\u3061\u3083\u3093**. Even Microsoft IME knows this word :)\n\nAnd her \"O then X\" motion is still as weird as it was the first time I've watched it. I think the explaination was that she agrees that someone who calles themself an airhead is not to be trusted (Agreed with the O-motion), but that wasn't the point (Disagreed with the X-motion).\n\nGnaa, and following that is one scene that was cut short from the LN. Basically Takasu's classmates wanted to get him to meet other girls then Taiga, since they really couldn't see him enjoying his time with her. Remember that Taiga is a lot more verbally abrasive in the LN.But he wanted to do that, and he thought to himself that cleaning up after Taiga for his whole life wasn't a bad outcome, since he carried so much guilt on him.\n\nThis wasn't a romantic thought , this was a thought of atonement. Taiga was special to him, but compared to Minorin, he didn't love her.\n\nThat was actually mentioned at the end of volume one, which would be the end of EP 2 in the anime.\n\nI'm pretty sure 2KBIR can tell you more about the novels, as he did a year long review of them, so he has way deeper knowledge then I do.\n\nThe confrontational scene between Ami and Taiga was also interesting, as it is quite enjoyable to see how Ami probes for Taigas weak spot.\n\nAnd suprisingly, taking Ryuuji from her is not something that she fears. As the bond between her and him is way too strong for Ami to disturb.\n\nBut we all know what would trigger her, and it does.\n\nLater on it turns out... when Ryuuji is there to cheer her up again: It's more the envy that triggers Taiga, not the fact she might badmouth her in front of Kitamura.\n\nBTW the stalker forshadowing bit was something that wasn't in the novels, but... as I said... is used for forshadowing in the anime.\n\nHow this plays out will be discussed at another point in time :).", "edited": 1670708018.0, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_izpg5wx", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><strong>Rewatcher -5-</strong></p>\n\n<p>This time I realized I can post at 10 PM local, not 1 AM like last year.

After yesterday\u2019s arguably Kitamura-centered madness, we finally round out the main cast of Toradora!\n\nLet\u2019s begin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpisode starts off with Taiga and Ry\u016bji ready for breakfast. They\u2019re eating some omurice. Taiga watches the news out of boredom since they couldn\u2019t get together with Kitamura. They get into an argument about getting with Kitamura, and it ends with Taiga spilling all her soup on her dress. Talk about karma. Yasu opens her door to find them eating without her and she cries. It won\u2019t be as tasty eating without them after all. Like how Taiga\u2019s concerned with her.  After Ry\u016bji calms his mom down, he offers to wash her dress and in return, ask Taiga predicts, take her to Jonny\u2019s. Ry\u016bji basically has to take care of two kids lol. Anyway after a brief shot of the cover of a magazine featuring our star of today, the intro plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey eat at Jonny\u2019s. Ry\u016bji is upset he didn\u2019t get to see her beloved Kushieda and Taiga blinds him yet again. Fifth time already. Anyways she finds a bag really cute, though Ryuji misunderstands and thinks she\u2019s talking about the outfit. She shoves the magazine into his face, and talks about how she\u2019s vertically challenged since she has short legs, acting like it\u2019s no big deal to her, but later on we find out that\u2019s not true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs they bicker, the star of the show arrives. Ami Kawashima, and joining her is Kitamura. Taiga and Ry\u016bji spit out their water in unison, and as they approach, Taiga grabs him and shakes him. They\u2019re so used to each other, they touch each other a lot without realizing it. This gets brought up in ep 14. Yusaku introduces Ami to the pair, Taiga wonders why Ami calls Kitamura by his first name, but is delighted to hear they\u2019re childhood friends. Taiga seems to like her but that will soon change. Kawashima acts all airheaded for Ryuji, and he gets so uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Kitamura heads to the restroom, Ryuji takes a quick glance at Taiga, she\u2019s sipping her iced tea, but she looks a bit irritated at Kawashima. Maybe because she\u2019s annoying or she\u2019s getting too close to Ryuji.As Ryuji tries to get away, Kitamura stops him, knowing he\u2019d do the same. Now that Ryuji\u2019s gone, Kawashima can remove that airhead facade to let out some steam. First order of business, get Taiga to fetch her some iced tea. Of course, Taiga doesn't follow her, similar to how she is with another blue haired girl related to Kitamura. Next she tries to get Ryuji to do it, calling him her boyfriend, but Taiga doesn\u2019t care either. As all this happens, Kitamura and Ryuji watch on. Kawashima hits home with her remark on Taiga\u2019s height. Ry\u016bji is quite surprised Taiga is holding back, thinking she would\u2019ve let her have it, but before he can finish, he slaps the chihuahua in the face. He didn\u2019t expect it, but he kinda did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Taiga is gorging herself at Ry\u016bji\u2019s, angry about Kawashima. She\u2019s upset about Kawashima, and distressed that Kitamura will be upset by her. Ry\u016bji tries to comfort her but she gets mad at him for making googly eyes at her, a hint at a possibility of jealousy. As she brushes some tears, she gorges on Ry\u016bji\u2019s food, saying she\u2019ll suck it up since she\u2019ll never see her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did see her again. Next morning, Kawashima transferred to Ohashi. Everyone is happy but our pair is shocked. As they transition into PE class, Kawashima is pretending to be an airhead once again. Taiga looks angrily while Minori uses her cute girl radar but picks up nothing. Ry\u016bji and Kitamura watches on, and Kitamura explains how he\u2019s never had a problem with her, he just wants her to have actual genuine friends being herself, and accepting that things might not go her way and not everyone will like her. Kitamura cares about Kawashima.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRy\u016bji thinks about this, and as he heads to the vending machine, he meets up with Kawashima, trying to get him on her side to get back at Taiga. Ry\u016bji\u2019s tries not to fall to her tricks. She mentions meeting girls that just don\u2019t like her, and she\u2019s used to it. Ry\u016bji\u2019s doesn\u2019t buy it, and he\u2019s probably right since she can\u2019t accept Taiga and she always tries to win everyone over. In 4th period, Taiga gives Ry\u016bji a note asking why he was with Kawashima, she\u2019s not too happy with him being with the chihuahua. He also gets a note from Kushieda, angry thinking he\u2019s cheating on Taiga. She still sees Taiga and Ry\u016bji as a couple no matter how much they deny it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter class is over, Ry\u016bji is talking to best boys Noto and Haruta. They\u2019re even inviting him to see some girls from the track team, but Ry\u016bji\u2019s got to attend to his girl instead. \\[Toradora ep 23 spoilers\\]>!Looking back, I guess it makes sense Haruta was able to get a girlfriend, Sena, since he was able to attract all these girls!<Taiga accidentally spilled what I presume to be milk on a locker. Ry\u016bji cleans it and tells Taiga to go home if she wants, but she stays behind for him to finish. I like this brief moment. Shows how Taiga doesn\u2019t want to leave Ry\u016bji behind and alone. Most students probably would be out of the campus by the time he finished cleaning so he\u2019d be all alone. Taiga patiently waits, and gets slightly happy when she thinks Ry\u016bji is there, but unfortunately it's a different dog. Kawashima teases Taiga, saying how all the teachers dislike her, but Taiga doesn\u2019t care and threatens her with stalking her, which hits home for Kawashima. Kawashima tries to threaten Taiga back with taking Ry\u016bji away, but she doesn\u2019t care either. Even if she may be jealous, she has seen Ry\u016bji and knows he wouldn\u2019t leave her all alone like that, and he probably won\u2019t fall that easily for her. Kawashima isn\u2019t ready to lose to Taiga so she threatens her with the knowledge that Kitamura \u201chates\u201d her because of that incident. Seeing as how Kawashima is Kitamura\u2019s childhood friend, Taiga would assume that as well. Ry\u016bji enters and figures out something happened between the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey go home, and Ry\u016bji serves some meat this time around, probably since Taiga complained last episode. Ry\u016bji mentions that food tastes better off the stove, and that sentence starts off very similarly to what Yasu said in ep 2 (this is gonna turn into a metaphor i swear). He wants Taiga to enjoy and eat with them. So he checks up on Taiga with a blue hoodie on. As he noticed Taiga curled up and crying, he cheers her up and reassures her it\u2019s gonna be okay, saying he knows everything. Taiga trusts Ry\u016bji and believes him, and Ry\u016bji adds Kitamura isn\u2019t the type of person to hate her over something so stupid. But Taiga wonders though, if that\u2019s the case, if he doesn\u2019t hate her, why is she tiny and why does she have a weird name. This isn\u2019t the stuff Kitamura hates about Taiga, but it\u2019s the stuff Taiga hates about herself. However, she pounces back up because of Ryuji\u2019s speech, though he kinda fumbles the bag when he mentions how it doesn\u2019t matter that Kawashima\u2019s been long friends with Kitamura, which earns him a pillow to the face because Taiga\u2019s sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYasu interrupts and asks for some sauce. Now that they\u2019ve resolved this issue, Taiga is able to help and get Ryuji to buy the sauce to make the food taste better. He and Taiga are able to properly enjoy the food since he motivated her to come for dinner, like their togetherness was the sauce, (that\u2019s definitely a reach. Bravo takemiya!!! Another food metaphor!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u2026Anyways they buy some sauce at what seems to be a knock-off 7/11. This area is a breeding ground for lawsuits, first Sudoh-Bucks, now Fm11. They figure out Kawashima has quit modeling. As the episode ends, they wonder why and they see her walking down the street with a bunch of junk food. Ryuji wonders if there\u2019s a party, but Taiga, knowing what it\u2019s like to feed off convenient store food for ages and eating a lot because of irritation, knows she\u2019s stress-eating. Gives us a real hint at Kawshima\u2019s isolation, and shows how she and Taiga might not be too different.Overall, a neat episode. It introduces us to Ami, who moves the plot forward a lot.

She still sees Taiga and Ry\u016bji as a couple no matter how much they deny it.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>After class is over, Ry\u016bji is talking to best boys Noto and Haruta. They\u2019re even inviting him to see some girls from the track team, but Ry\u016bji\u2019s got to attend to his girl instead. [Toradora ep 23 spoilers]<span class=\"md-spoiler-text\">Looking back, I guess it makes sense Haruta was able to get a girlfriend, Sena, since he was able to attract all these girls</span>Taiga accidentally spilled what I presume to be milk on a locker. Ry\u016bji cleans it and tells Taiga to go home if she wants, but she stays behind for him to finish. I like this brief moment. Shows how Taiga doesn\u2019t want to leave Ry\u016bji behind and alone. Most students probably would be out of the campus by the time he finished cleaning so he\u2019d be all alone. Taiga patiently waits, and gets slightly happy when she thinks Ry\u016bji is there, but unfortunately it&#39;s a different dog. Kawashima teases Taiga, saying how all the teachers dislike her, but Taiga doesn\u2019t care and threatens her with stalking her, which hits home for Kawashima. Kawashima tries to threaten Taiga back with taking Ry\u016bji away, but she doesn\u2019t care either. Even if she may be jealous, she has seen Ry\u016bji and knows he wouldn\u2019t leave her all alone like that, and he probably won\u2019t fall that easily for her. Kawashima isn\u2019t ready to lose to Taiga so she threatens her with the knowledge that Kitamura \u201chates\u201d her because of that incident. Seeing as how Kawashima is Kitamura\u2019s childhood friend, Taiga would assume that as well. Ry\u016bji enters and figures out something happened between the two.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>They go home, and Ry\u016bji serves some meat this time around, probably since Taiga complained last episode. Ry\u016bji mentions that food tastes better off the stove, and that sentence starts off very similarly to what Yasu said in ep 2 (this is gonna turn into a metaphor i swear). He wants Taiga to enjoy and eat with them. So he checks up on Taiga with a blue hoodie on. As he noticed Taiga curled up and crying, he cheers her up and reassures her it\u2019s gonna be okay, saying he knows everything. Taiga trusts Ry\u016bji and believes him, and Ry\u016bji adds Kitamura isn\u2019t the type of person to hate her over something so stupid. But Taiga wonders though, if that\u2019s the case, if he doesn\u2019t hate her, why is she tiny and why does she have a weird name. This isn\u2019t the stuff Kitamura hates about Taiga, but it\u2019s the stuff Taiga hates about herself. However, she pounces back up because of Ryuji\u2019s speech, though he kinda fumbles the bag when he mentions how it doesn\u2019t matter that Kawashima\u2019s been long friends with Kitamura, which earns him a pillow to the face because Taiga\u2019s sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Yasu interrupts and asks for some sauce. Now that they\u2019ve resolved this issue, Taiga is able to help and get Ryuji to buy the sauce to make the food taste better. He and Taiga are able to properly enjoy the food since he motivated her to come for dinner, like their togetherness was the sauce, (that\u2019s definitely a reach. Bravo takemiya!!! Another food metaphor!!!)</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>\u2026Anyways they buy some sauce at what seems to be a knock-off 7/11. This area is a breeding ground for lawsuits, first Sudoh-Bucks, now Fm11. They figure out Kawashima has quit modeling. As the episode ends, they wonder why and they see her walking down the street with a bunch of junk food. Ryuji wonders if there\u2019s a party, but Taiga, knowing what it\u2019s like to feed off convenient store food for ages and eating a lot because of irritation, knows she\u2019s stress-eating. Gives us a real hint at Kawshima\u2019s isolation, and shows how she and Taiga might not be too different.Overall, a neat episode. It introduces us to Ami, who moves the plot forward a lot. Excited to dive deeper into the next episode!</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izrdw4j/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670742842.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi3c0e", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 3, "_fetched": true}

Similar to how Hunter x Hunter, FMAB, and Shaman King took around a decade after their initial adaptations to get readapted. </p>\n\n<p>I think another couple of years will also really help the visual aspect of the Berserk adaptation. At this point in time, there is very little chance we would get an adaptation that doesn&#39;t have a large number of CGI monsters or large battles. CGI has been getting better quite quickly this last decade and I&#39;m sure it will be even more impressive and well-integrated if the industry is given the proper time to really practice using and integrating it well. I would prefer an awesome spectacle of only 2d animation but honestly, I don&#39;t think that it will realistically happen.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": "dark", "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/anime/comments/zi1yz3/berserks_mysterious_70_days_countdown_ends_with/izpr72b/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1670712292.0, "author_flair_text": ":Ae::Af::Ag:=:Ah::Ai::Aj::Y::A:anilist.co/user/Abyssbringer", "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_zi1yz3", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/anime", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": "", "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 7, "_fetched": true}
