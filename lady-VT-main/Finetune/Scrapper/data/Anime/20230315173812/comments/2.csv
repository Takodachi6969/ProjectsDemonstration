izpul5k,zi5mu6,"I personally like the Vol. 3-8 approach.  I understand the show started as a comedy.  However, there's limits to how long that can last.  I think it has a good 4-5 volumes left to finish the story.  I'm enjoying it mostly.  It has some derpy choices on occasion, but I really like certain characters (Qrow/Salem/Winter Schnee/NEO!).  I don't think it counts as anime, but it has all the trappings and features a lot of Funimation/CR actors throughout the cast...so, I don't really care.\n\nThe music and fight scenes really help the show when the story stalls though.\n\nI do think the anti-fandom is gets a little tiring (mostly people who used to like it but dropped off).

izpcf22,zi3c0e,"Hello guys. Holofan4life here happy to participate in yet another Toradora rewatch thread.\n\nToradora is my favorite anime of all time. As such, I know the series like the back of my hand. I’m going to analyze each episode BEFORE I actually watch the episode. And then after I watch it, I will give my real time thoughts on the episode. But I won’t be analyzing the episode as a whole. You fine folk do such a good job with that already. I will be analyzing a certain character from each episode and give some thoughts on what’s going on in their head. I thought that would be something different and fun.\n\nAlso, I am bringing back the ranking of the episodes. It’s been such a while since I last done it, I figure why not do it again.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s begin.\n\nCome on. You know. You know who I’ll be analyzing today. It’s all about the Ami, baby.\n\nAmi is to Toradora what Valerie is to 90210. She makes a great show even better just by her presence. Toradora would be your run-of-the-mill romcom, except Ami lit the match and set that whole idea on fire.\n\nI’m gonna have a fun time analyzing Ami because you can tell she’s not really about making friends. She’s all about getting people to idolize her and worship the ground she walks on. Ami is like all the worst attributes of Taiga that Taiga’s classmates speculate her having. Once again, proving you should never judge a book by its cover.\n\nI of course really like the beginning scene where Ami is trying her damndest to act like the sweet innocent girl next door. And the scary thing is, it’s actually believable. Anime has had a long line of ditzy, foggy minded characters, especially when it comes to harem/romance anime. So when Toradora introduces a seemingly ditzy character, that’s what you’re expecting, as we already have a genki character as well as a tsundere. But as soon as Ryuuji leaves the table, she becomes an entirely different person.\n\nSee, she doesn’t mind showing her true colors around Taiga. That’s because she’s not trying to impress Taiga. She’s trying to impress Ryuuji. Ami knows if she keeps up with the charade, she’ll probably have her wrapped around her little finger. Because there’s nothing more perfect than a hot girl that’s attainable.\n\nAnd then of course in the classroom scene, Ami is like a kid in a candy store. She’s like a dog being in a room with a 100 mailman. They’re practically falling over each other praising Ami because they know she’s the model girl, and they want to hang out with her. And she relishes in it because she loves to be popular. I think with the scene with Taiga and Ami sitting alone in the booth, Ami I feel like can tell she can’t pull the wool over her eyes. That’s why she doesn’t even try. But with the other classmates, they are so enamored with her because they know her as that girl on TV that it’s easy to not show her true colors. They’re ripe for the picking.\n\nAnd then finally, with the scene where Ami lies to Taiga about Kitamura, this is her trying to state her dominance. She sees Taiga as a threat and someone who could possibly expose her, so she does what she can to pick at her? Does she honestly care about hurting her feelings? I don’t think so. I don’t think Ami knows Taiga enough to harbor a grudge. But just like a shark who smells blood in the water, she makes sure to try and tackle one of Taiga’s weak points to show how superior she is.\n\nThe genius of Ami as a character is that she helps evolve the other characters. That’s later on her purpose, which we’ll get to. The other genius of Ami is that by comparison, she makes Taiga far more likable. Compared to Ami, Taiga is like a saint. Ami makes Taiga seem like Minori. The show makes the conscious decision of having a character who’s nastier than Taiga so that you can have someone you can root against when they butt heads with her, and it just works so well.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the scene with the vending machines. While I think Ami is still trying to put on the ditzy act to win over Ryuuji, that scene is the one part of the episode involving her where I feel the true her really comes out. Yes, she is still doing the act. And yes, you could argue her blunt attitude in the booth scene with Taiga is her true personality. But I think there’s a lot of truth in what Ami is saying about a lot of girls hating her making her stronger.\n\nAmi comes from the world of modeling. It’s a very cutthroat business, with people always gunning for the top by any means necessary. It wouldn’t surprise me if Ami created this alternate persona so that she can deceive others and make sure she ended up at the top. To extend on this theory, maybe Ami felt she had no other choice but to create the fake personality so that she’s less prone to getting hurt. Kinda similar to Taiga seemingly driving people away by her violent antics so that she doesn’t get hurt. Maybe in actuality, Taiga and Ami have more in common than they realize.\nJust some food for thought.\n\n**Post episode discussion**\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great episode, and in my opinion probably the second most important episode in the entire series. It really sets up a lot of themes that will be prevalent throughout the rest of the show, in particular being something you’re not. We already got that theme a bit with Ryuuji and Taiga not being as awful as their reputation suggests, but Ami takes it to another level by intentionally being something she’s not. This sets the tone for characters wearing masks, which we also saw a bit with Minori in episode 3.\n\nBecause the character I analyzed was Ami, there’s not much else to say about this episode. It is really ultimately about Ami and not really anyone else. Couple things I want to note are I think it’s adorable to see Taiga actually try to help Ryuuji out around the house more. It shows how much she wants to play an active role in Ryuuji’s life. Second, when Taiga slapped Ami across the face, if you look carefully, there actually was a fly. She wasn’t joking. Third, I guess Kitamura’s friendship with Ami set him to fall in love with Taiga. He must love aggressive girls. But if that’s the case, why didn’t he fall in love with Ami? My theory is Kitamura wants to end up with the real deal rather than someone who’s disingenuous. Kitamura tolerates Ami because he knows deep down inside lies probably a good person, but he doesn’t want to be with someone who’s always putting on an act.\n\nOne last thing I want to make note of that I didn’t pick up on in my previous rewatches is the sound design is exquisite. It really helps make jokes land. Taiga shoving the magazine in Ryuuji’s face, Taiga turning Ryuuji’s head, the sound of Ryuuji’s neck cracking as he turns his head back around, the sound design adds a level of humor to the show that the show would be missing without it. It’s really stellar stuff.\n\n**Episode Rankings**\n\n1. Episode 2\n2. **Episode 5**\n3. Episode 4\n4. Episode 1\n5.

And if Scary Eyes hadn't been watching the whole thing he'd probably buy it, and there's no *way* Shorty would bother to explain it properly if he confronted her. \n\nxD That second note! xD Please don't change Madoka. And her reaction to *his* note. Funniest part of the episode so far. xD \n\n> What is wrong with you people? \n\n*So very much*, and I love them for it. \n\nOh boy, is Princess actually, *legitimately* scared of Midget? Was that the first time she'd been slapped like that or something? Oooh, and she found a chink in the armour. A very effective chink, it seems. \n\nUntil her totally-not-a-slave finally figures out how to say the right thing again, anyway. And off for dinner they go! \n\nHey, uh, Midget? Should I be worried about that smirk? What did you figure out? Is Princess' life in danger? \n\n...'suck it you dumb chihuahua'?

I hate her character, but she brings an unexpected dynamic to the show and is vital for reasons I can't say yet. I guess a way to describe her would be duplicitous. She acts all clumsy and cute to get people to like her, while being conniving and mean when nobody _important_ is looking.\n\nThe fact that our protagonists know what she is doing makes the interactions engaging. Taiga is originally hurt by the thought Kitamura may hate her. But all it took was Ryuuji telling her that Kitamura knows about Ami's true character to cheer up Taiga.\n\nDuring my first watch I know my big question at this point was ""When will Ami be punished for her actions"". But I think the better version of my question is really ""Is her personality actually 'wrong'"".  \n\nOf course lying is amoral. But at the same time, its extremely rare to find somebody that acts the same around everyone. You'll discuss different topics and be more polite when at a formal meeting versus when speaking to close friends and family. I like the analogy of wearing a mask. Its also a big part of Japanese social norms ([本音と建前](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae)) which is what I think Ami's character right now is an exaggeration of.\n\nThe other side of that is why does she act this way? We have learned a couple things about her past and living situation, but I won't point out anything yet to avoid hinting at spoilers. For now, lets just watch what she does.\n\n### Some Amazing Shots, Scenes and Stitches\n\n* [Childhood Friends](https://imgur.com/s7ZKlcR)\n* [Spit Take](https://imgur.com/EYtemBZ), mods why isn't this a comment face\n* [Cute Girl Detector](https://imgur.com/emU8FO7)\n* [Thoughts](https://imgur.com/aGMlo4E)\n* [Cocoon](https://imgur.com/DJ8tbeW)\n\nSee you all tomorrow!",1670706338,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpdhna/
izpdm3u,zi3c0e,"###5th Time Dub Rewatcher. 2nd time reading the books.\n\nFinally we get to meet Ami. She’s a really interesting character. She’s got a mean streak and she puts up the perfect, nice girl facade, but there’s more to her than that.\n\nIf you’re watching in sub or with captions, you might miss this (because it’s hidden behind the captions). When Taiga slaps Ami in the face, she really did kill a fly and it’s on her hand afterwards. The first time I watched it I thought she made up a fake excuse to slap her in the face lol.\n\nIt’s amusing watching Ami think she’s got Ryuuji wrapped around her finger. She has a lot of internal monologue about this in the book.\n\n[Nightmare fuel](https://i.imgur.com/srUlGu3.jpg)\n\n[The book illustration is also hilarious](https://i.imgur.com/pGYj8i5.jpg)\n\n###On to the books!\n\nEpisode 5 ends right at the end of book 2 chapter 3. This episode is a pretty faithful adaptation of the first half of book 2 aside from dropped details and minor scene changes.\n\nOne thing that was a bit different is the part where Taiga is waiting in the classroom for Ryuuji to clean out her locker. Ryuuji was outside of the classroom the whole time listening to what Ami was saying to Taiga so he was already aware of what had happened. Ryuuji had already talked to Taiga about Kitamura having seen the whole incident in the restaurant but it still bothered Taiga enough that she holed herself up in her apartment.\n\nAdditionally, the scene where Ryuuji comes over to Taiga’s apartment to get her for dinner is a bit more intimate. Her nest is on the couch in her living room instead of on the bed.\n\n>There was a moment of hesitation. But Ryuuji made up his mind and flipped over the top of the couch. Ryuuji held his knees and sat down beside Taiga, who was hiding in her nest like a baby cub.\n\nTaiga talks about her insecurities a bit comparing herself to Ami and then\n\n>she had a cooling patch stuck on her round forehead. She might have developed a bump. Ryuuji felt a sting in his heart, and mostly subconsciously, gently rubbed the patch. Taiga didn’t push his hand away.\n\nFinally, the incident where they catch Ami with all of the junk food. They see her before she goes into the convenience store and watch her stacking a basket. Even the clerk is staring at her amused.\n\nAnd here are some choice moments I highlighted while I was reading.\n\n>Taiga’s swaying, waist-length hair was softly tangled, the color of chestnut touched by smoke. Her delicate body was enveloped in a fluffy dress piled with lace. Paired with her figure, Ryuuji thought the unbleached overskirt left her with an elegantly volumized and cute— (interrupted by Taiga yelling at him lol)\n\n>Although Taiga wasn’t living with them, on their days off, they were together during the day. They were together at night. They were together while shopping. They had an unwritten rule that she wouldn’t stay overnight, but it wasn’t uncommon for them to doze off after dinner and keep each other company late into the night. They were pretty much living together, but they weren’t involved, not as a couple, anyway. But as Taiga stood up, Ryuuji dawdled, lingering behind her.\n\n>It might’ve had something to do with the accidental way he found out about how brave Taiga really was, or how she was pretty much an underdog, but he felt like he’d pick Taiga’s personality over Ami’s every time.\n\n>This definitely wasn’t him throwing away a chance at a girlfriend in order to take care of Taiga—definitely not. He was just cleaning up something that Taiga had made a mess of. Taiga had made an unbelievable blunder, and he was just picking up the pieces—that was it. He just wanted to be by her every day so that he could instantly cover for her. So Noto was wrong.",1670706386,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpdm3u/
izprqsd,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher**  \n  \nToday we learned that indeed, the most dangerous hair color in Toradora is blue. Sumire gave off a very bossy impression and now we got a really big handful of a girl that is Ami Kawashima. But with her, our OP crew is complete at last!  \n  \nThe funniest moment for me - and I haven't noticed it until this rewatch - was when Taiga and Ryuuji were meeting Kitamura and Ami at the restaurant. Taiga forcefully turns Ryuuji's head to the entrance where the two stand. Afterwards, when he turns his head back on Taiga, you just have that incredibly painful crunchy sound as if the bones had to get back to a normal position. Ouch. It was such a freaky detail, I had to laugh.  \n  \nOh well, the fun won't last that long. Quickly it shows that Ami's true personality is not the cute airhead but a manipulative ""princess"" who pretty much just provokes Taiga whenever possible. I think her vanity is also insane. It's not because she's a model but just because Taiga is the least bit interested in her in the beginning, I'm sure of it. After Kitamura left, she didn't change her gears when Ryuuji was still on the scene.  \nThe fact that Kitamura hasn't told Ami that the school she's transferring to is the same as Taiga's also made her true nature come out since she could assume it's a one-off encounter where she doesn't have to uphold her fake personality. In that regard, it's a really clever thing for Kitamura to do. How he can stand Ami is hard to imagine with the behavior we've seen but there must be something and sooner or later, we may find it.  \n  \nWhat makes it bearable for us viewers is that Taiga isn't a mere victim, she trades blows with her in a different way by being raw and not keeping up an appearance. While she does fight back, the jabs from Ami definitely leave scars or at least make her very vulnerable afterwards. She at least shows that to Ryuuji and it's a really nice touch to see how trusting they've gotten over the course of the series so far already. I want someone with the reliability and care of Ryuuji but I wish for a more careful choice of words.  \n  \nThat was what I thought I'd expand upon for this episode. Off to the random notes:  \n- Yasuko MVP! Just telling her son to get Taiga for dinner. She feels very aloof and clumsy but she cares. She really values her.  \n- The scene in the classroom after school was tense. Ami *really* wanted to get under Taiga's skin and threw everything and the kitchen sink at her to achieve that goal. Taiga was hit but she also traded a blow by keeping an eye on her and her fake act. She looks so nonchalant and bored when saying it. It's some psychological warfare there and it already looks like scorched earth is the way to go.  \n- [There *is* a dot](https://imgur.com/3QNOe8c) on Taiga's hand after hitting Ami. Maaaaaybe she was saying the truth about the mosquito/fly, who knows.  \n- There's this cliché that main protagonists always sit on the window side. By that logic, [Ami](https://imgur.com/ArGaxHv) and [Kitamura](https://imgur.com/mPTpvcj) should be the main protagonists! [Ryuuji](https://imgur.com/ArGaxHv) has to have both columns next to him animated for extra work, [Minori gets to chill](https://imgur.com/DHal0Oe) door-side and Taiga is also between two columns.  \n- Continuing seats: with all the shots so far, you can map out for each student, how they look and where they're sitting. I checked the [2nd episode](https://imgur.com/3Nlksb0) and the seat positions are consistent. [Maya's seat](https://imgur.com/1TAs3gS) being empty in this screencap top right is also a great detail. It's quite a lot of work for characters who'll likely never play a big role and they have different looks.  \n- Everyone turns to Minori when she does her thing and [Kitamura doesn't notice](https://imgur.com/mPTpvcj) any of the commotion at all. Certainly straight-laced, role model student!  \n- Calling oneself an airhead is a red flag assumingly. I can kinda see where that sentiment is coming from.  \n- [Definite spoiler]>!If someone should know about playing a facade, it should be Minori. Heh. Good person to ask the airhead question, Ryuuji. This scene in hindsight is so much foreshadowing, it hurts. Same with Ami being ticked off after Taiga threatens her to keep an eye on her like a stalker.!<  \n  \nThis is one hell of an introduction episode for a character and damn does Ami make an impression! Let's see how it goes next episode! Until then, fellow watchers!",1670712549,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izprqsd/

izpz1l6,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher**\n\nAnd with this episode the main characters have been assembled. I'm not really a fan of Ami, her personality does its job in getting on my nerves and it's definitely on full display here. I'm really glad we didn't have to spend a whole episode just to dramatically discover her true nature like some other shows.\n\nOther observations I made:\n\n- I really appreciate the snark Ryuji showed Taiga this episode. It really shows how much their relationship has deepened, to the point that he feels comfortable throwing jabs at her now.\n- Bit of a tangent here, but I've always found the way that anime portrays ""model"" characters to be a bit confusing. Sure I guess Ami is pretty, and she's certainly drawn that way, but that classification applies to basically every other female character we see. It's probably just a symptom of the art style but I struggle to make the distinction between ""pretty"" and ""average"" anime girl a lot and it kinda screws with my suspension of disbelief.  \n- Ah yes, the unexpected horror that is Junji Ito Minorin face.\n- I think it's a bit strange Ryuji didn't mention to Taiga that Kitamura was aware of Ami's nature earlier, especially since I think he's usually pretty alert to this kind of stuff, but I guess he did get cut off earlier. \n\n**Bonus**: Despite my personal opinions, She works as an excellent foil to Taiga though so her inclusion in the story is still a positive.",1670715936,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpz1l6/

izpchii,zi3c0e,"Rewatcher here\n\nI’m not sure it was a great idea to introduce us to two blue haired girls that make Taiga jealous in back to back episodes. But yes, THIS is the last person from the intro this time. \n\nEveryone’s color schemes are weird, except for maybe Ryuji. I’m talking about how in the intro and outro everyone has a color associated with them. Almost everyone at least gets bright, fun colors, and then poor Kitamura gets stuck with this putrid brown, yellow, green kind of color. I wonder if there’s any reason for who they matched to what color, because if not they just hit the random button for everyone, and then stuck Kitamura with that puke color. \n\nRyuji was really overreacting to getting some water thrown at his face. He acted like she threw acid at his face. \n\nI get that Taiga doesn’t see Ryuji in that way, but saying “gross” when Kitamura asked if they were on a date is just harsh. \n\nTaiga actually had a fly on her hand after slapping Ami, if you ask me, she didn’t do anything wrong. Plus provoking the most violent character on the show isn’t a super smart idea. \n\nRyuji just gave up trying to let Taiga know him and Kitamura know what actually happened after she ignored him once. He could have saved her from a lot of problems later this episode. \n\nI’m sure it was supposed that she tripped on something while walking, but it just looks like she was standing still and somehow managed to wipe out. \n\nIt’s against school rules to get drinks after lunch, but that’s exactly what Ryuji was about to do. Maybe he actually is a delinquent thug after all for rebelling against the school like that. (That rule is extremely stupid, I can’t imagine anyone would actually enforce it)\n\nMan how many times do they have to tell everyone that they’re not dating. Taiga’s best friend should know that better than anyone.  \n\nHaruta has some game if he can pull three girls at the same time while also letting Ryuji and Noto meet them too. What a team player. \n\nTaiga is really letting a lot of stuff slide from Ami without attacking her. If anyone else said those kinds of things to her they’d be in the hospital right now. \n\nRyuji is great at cheering Taiga up, until he’s not. He turned Taiga’s mood completely around, and then had to shoot her down again when he reminded her of Ami and Kitamura’s history. \n\nI’m not sure if this is going to make sense, but I always viewed this as the official start of Toradora.

Its funny how, although her ""true personality"" is harsh and tough to appreciate, but once you know it, her fake personality is SO MUCH worse.\n\nIt's really sad, later in the ep, seeing more of how Taiga feels about herself.\n\n\[Toradora!\] >!Rewatching the Ami-Taiga classroom scene was interesting - first time it felt a little unclear what ticked Ami off about what Taiga said, but now its clear. Taiga accidentally hit on Ami's fear of her stalker. Yikes.!<",1670710234,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpmp36/
izpqbuc,zi3c0e,"Rewatcher\n\nThat double spit take is a great comedic moment. Nice of Kitamura to say up front that they were friends rather than anything else. We finally meet Ami Kawashima, the final named character in the opening.\n\nAmi's acting performance sure is something - also pretty shitty being that forward when she thinks that Ryuuji and Taiga are dating. Taiga is not the sort of person to stand for that shit though, love the disinterested response, switching to the slap at the mention of her height (which Taiga referenced about herself earlier) clued Ami into a weak point though.\n\nClass openly celebrating Ami switching in, Midori is on the case though. Love Ami's reponse to seeing Taiga is in the same class as her though, realises things aren't going to be as simple as she thought, hence her damage control attempt at the vending machines. Thanks to Kitamura, Ryuuji isn't buying it now though. \n\nKitamura playing a long game to help improve Ami's personality is an odd approach to being a friend but fits in well with what we know about him. He fell for Taiga because she was open about how she felt about things. Its a quality he values, so it makes sense that he would want Ami to be more honest with people.\n\nTo have the multiple personas and generally be able to get away with it shows that Ami is actually quite intelligent, in order to be able to keep the versions of herself appropriately (in her mind) separate and she would probably be quite successful regardless. Her modelling career would have impacted on her ability to have multiple personalities as well in a way that most people wouldn't need to deal with. \n\nPart of Ami's airhead persona involves clumsiness which she uses to get positive attention. Taiga, who is actually clumsy, often has bad things happen as a result of that, so I can see the difference in response there also pissing Taiga off. With an example later in the episode with the locker. Also, Ami randomly throwing herself to the ground would be so odd in real life (I guess she could've been stretching or something), but I guess thats why it happens off camera.\n\nThe notes from Taiga and Minori are interesting. We know why Taiga doesn't like Ami but its a mystery to everyone other than the four who were at the diner. The class would've been aware of the note and seen Ryuuji's response, along with Ami and Ryuuji returning late to class, and Ryuuji spending a lot of time with Taiga the rumour mill will start churning again. Most importantly, and bad for Ryuuji is that Midori clearly thinks that he and Taiga are in a relationship. Midori's response to Ryuuji's question is great though.\n\nAmi and Taiga both get some good insults in during their argument in the classroom. I would give the first round to Ami, but Taiga is developing a plan. Ryuuji probably should have told Taiga that he and Kitamura knew what Ami was like that first night at the diner when she was complaining.\n\nA bit of intrigue when we see Ami walking with junk food and dressed down to end the episode. \n\nYasuko is great as always.\n\nAs to whether I like Ami, initially I didn't - both from this episode (which seems pretty clearly to be intended) and for a good part of my initial watch of the show. Having seen the series multiple times now, I would say she is my second favourite character behind Taiga.",1670711890,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpqbuc/
izq5fex,zi3c0e,"Halo-halo.\n\nThis episode is where the real *Toradora!* slowly starts. \n\nAmi is an essential character for the plot and the main characters' chemistry. \n\nShe's also a character I remember liking ever since I first saw her.\n\nThis episode is important because it's arguably the first time *Toradora!* introduces a slightly serious topic, a shift in tone from what could be described before this as a pure slapstick comedy without really much to it.\n\nBut all that is yet to be seen, and is clear only in retrospect.\n\nOn a side note, I didn't remember the show being *that* comical and light-hearted. It handles it well but is at times a bit *too* unserious for my taste.\n\nIn this ep, we also get some interesting main pair moments, from [Taiga holding Ryuuji's cuff](https://i.imgur.com/nUxYwAg.jpg) to them doing groceries to him [looking at her gently](https://i.imgur.com/OTGlOMz.jpg) ~~in her bedroom~~. \nNone of these moments are lampshaded in much of a way, still.\n\nP.S.

Nope, just childhood friends.\n\nAmi's acting all cute and flirty and stuff, but the reality is she's an asshole when men aren't around. \n\nTaiga says she'll never see Ami again, so naturally, she shows up as the new transfer student at school.

izpg5wx,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher -5-**\n\nThis time I realized I can post at 10 PM local, not 1 AM like last year. That makes everything a lot easier :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ami episode\n\nWe start of at golden week, which gives us a very good indication how much time has passed.\n\nSchoolyears in Japan start on April 1st, and Goldenweek is around the end of April and beginning of May.\n\nSo about a month has passed between EP 1 and EP5.\n\nI'm not going into translating the TV or the advertisment, either because it's irrelevant dribble or I'm not entirely sure what they are trying to tell us. I'm still learning Japanese, so I'm not able to explain more difficult concepts.\n\nAnyway, the ad foreshadows Amis introduction, as will Taiga reading the catalogue in the café, right before Ami enteres.\n\nAnd I have to say the cartoony ""moving the head and spitting out at the same time"" also happened in the novel.\n\nTakemiya sensei didn't take her work tooo seriously.\n\nAmi calls herself ""Ami-chan"". There is really not a more anime-style way of talking about yourself. She reaaaly thinks she is hot stuff, or she wouldn't adress herself this way.\n\nThis whole scene is of course meant to introduce the 2 sides of Ami, which might look petty now, but has a reasonable foundation behind it, as we will see later.\n\nI don't remember if this is just an artifact of the german dub, but Ami also claims that this town is pretty boring. I think this is somewhat important as the anime takes inspirational shots from Tokyo wards, so you might think we are in the Tokyou-to area.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case if she claims that. The outer burrows of Tokyou-to can be sparse, but it's still not that far into the more interesting districts like Shibuya or Shinjuku.\n\n**大橋,** which means ""Big Bridge"", the town the story takes place in, is IMO located somewhere in the Kanto region, but not in Tokyou-to.\n\nI'll explain later why I think this is, besides the fact that Ami is bored about the small town she is in right now.\n\nThe title of this episode is just ""Kawashima Ami"" in all-kana, so there is no point in analyzing this.\n\nAmis Kanji are quite straight forward:\n\n**川嶋　亜美**, with Kanji for ""river"", ""island"", ""Asia, next"" and ""beautiful"". The island kanji is a name-kanji variant, but it's still easy enough to recognize how it should be pronounced. The fact that both Taiga and Ami have ""river"" in their full names, even with different variants, might be an indication that they are not as different as it looks.\n\nI think it's quite interesting how she trys to lure Ryuuji back into a good standing with her. She is quite skilled with it, not gonna lie, this should usually work. The treat with the coffe, the little apology, the taking him by the hand, creating physical contact etc. This is quite the skillfull, and very feminine, way of luring someone onto ones side. If it wasn't for Kitamura telling him what's going on, I think Ryuuji would have been in the dark a bit longer.\n\nBut since Taiga is very special to him (I don't know if anything about Ryuujis past was already discussed, so I refrain from spoiling the reason why Taiga is special to him), this wouldn't have lasted anyway. Taiga is not a liar. Quite the opposite, it's her inabilty to put on a fake smile like Ami which brings her so much sadness.\n\nOnto Minorins letter: LOL for her using the word ""Transferstudent-chan""   \n\-> **転校生ちゃん**. Even Microsoft IME knows this word :)\n\nAnd her ""O then X"" motion is still as weird as it was the first time I've watched it. I think the explaination was that she agrees that someone who calles themself an airhead is not to be trusted (Agreed with the O-motion), but that wasn't the point (Disagreed with the X-motion).\n\nGnaa, and following that is one scene that was cut short from the LN. Basically Takasu's classmates wanted to get him to meet other girls then Taiga, since they really couldn't see him enjoying his time with her. Remember that Taiga is a lot more verbally abrasive in the LN.But he wanted to do that, and he thought to himself that cleaning up after Taiga for his whole life wasn't a bad outcome, since he carried so much guilt on him.\n\nThis wasn't a romantic thought , this was a thought of atonement. Taiga was special to him, but compared to Minorin, he didn't love her.\n\nThat was actually mentioned at the end of volume one, which would be the end of EP 2 in the anime.\n\nI'm pretty sure 2KBIR can tell you more about the novels, as he did a year long review of them, so he has way deeper knowledge then I do.\n\nThe confrontational scene between Ami and Taiga was also interesting, as it is quite enjoyable to see how Ami probes for Taigas weak spot.\n\nAnd suprisingly, taking Ryuuji from her is not something that she fears. As the bond between her and him is way too strong for Ami to disturb.\n\nBut we all know what would trigger her, and it does.\n\nLater on it turns out... when Ryuuji is there to cheer her up again: It's more the envy that triggers Taiga, not the fact she might badmouth her in front of Kitamura.\n\nBTW the stalker forshadowing bit was something that wasn't in the novels, but... as I said... is used for forshadowing in the anime.\n\nHow this plays out will be discussed at another point in time :).",1670707406,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpg5wx/
izppupb,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher, Dubbed** \n\nAmi is finally here! I might be slightly biased as she's a top three character for me, basically tied with the coleads, but even with that aside I really enjoyed this episode. \n\nTaiga and Ryuuji feel a bit closer this time, both in the way they interact but also by being more supportive of eachother. There could've been some forced conflict for example where Ryuuji got mad at Taiga for slapping Ami, but instead he was just sort of quietly there for her. Then he does it again at the end when he cheers her up in her apartment.\n\nGetting back to the focus of the episode, Ami's introduction, I think its very well done narratively. Despite their instant antagonism, Ami and Taiga have an interesting dynamic, both kind of lash out when threatened, but in different ways. Another aspect I like about it is that Ryuuji as our protagonist knows what Ami is doing from the beginning, rather than having it be a twist sometime down the line. Because Ryuuji has that understanding, he treats Ami differently than he probably would've, which alters the whole dynamic. The episode also does a good job of establishing Ami as more than just a rival or antagonist by hinting at her situation. It does also help that an established character vouches for her, she's not just a random character who drops in with no connection to the characters.",1670711671,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izppupb/

izrdw4j,zi3c0e,"(\*\*Rewatcher - First Rewatch\*\*)\n\nHere we got the introduction to Ami Kawashima! After yesterday’s arguably Kitamura-centered madness, we finally round out the main cast of Toradora!\n\nLet’s begin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpisode starts off with Taiga and Ryūji ready for breakfast. They’re eating some omurice. Taiga watches the news out of boredom since they couldn’t get together with Kitamura. They get into an argument about getting with Kitamura, and it ends with Taiga spilling all her soup on her dress. Talk about karma. Yasu opens her door to find them eating without her and she cries. It won’t be as tasty eating without them after all. Like how Taiga’s concerned with her.  After Ryūji calms his mom down, he offers to wash her dress and in return, ask Taiga predicts, take her to Jonny’s. Ryūji basically has to take care of two kids lol. Anyway after a brief shot of the cover of a magazine featuring our star of today, the intro plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey eat at Jonny’s. Ryūji is upset he didn’t get to see her beloved Kushieda and Taiga blinds him yet again. Fifth time already. Anyways she finds a bag really cute, though Ryuji misunderstands and thinks she’s talking about the outfit. She shoves the magazine into his face, and talks about how she’s vertically challenged since she has short legs, acting like it’s no big deal to her, but later on we find out that’s not true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs they bicker, the star of the show arrives. Ami Kawashima, and joining her is Kitamura. Taiga and Ryūji spit out their water in unison, and as they approach, Taiga grabs him and shakes him. They’re so used to each other, they touch each other a lot without realizing it. This gets brought up in ep 14. Yusaku introduces Ami to the pair, Taiga wonders why Ami calls Kitamura by his first name, but is delighted to hear they’re childhood friends. Taiga seems to like her but that will soon change. Kawashima acts all airheaded for Ryuji, and he gets so uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Kitamura heads to the restroom, Ryuji takes a quick glance at Taiga, she’s sipping her iced tea, but she looks a bit irritated at Kawashima. Maybe because she’s annoying or she’s getting too close to Ryuji.As Ryuji tries to get away, Kitamura stops him, knowing he’d do the same. Now that Ryuji’s gone, Kawashima can remove that airhead facade to let out some steam. First order of business, get Taiga to fetch her some iced tea. Of course, Taiga doesn't follow her, similar to how she is with another blue haired girl related to Kitamura. Next she tries to get Ryuji to do it, calling him her boyfriend, but Taiga doesn’t care either. As all this happens, Kitamura and Ryuji watch on. Kawashima hits home with her remark on Taiga’s height. Ryūji is quite surprised Taiga is holding back, thinking she would’ve let her have it, but before he can finish, he slaps the chihuahua in the face. He didn’t expect it, but he kinda did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Taiga is gorging herself at Ryūji’s, angry about Kawashima. She’s upset about Kawashima, and distressed that Kitamura will be upset by her. Ryūji tries to comfort her but she gets mad at him for making googly eyes at her, a hint at a possibility of jealousy. As she brushes some tears, she gorges on Ryūji’s food, saying she’ll suck it up since she’ll never see her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did see her again. Next morning, Kawashima transferred to Ohashi. Everyone is happy but our pair is shocked. As they transition into PE class, Kawashima is pretending to be an airhead once again. Taiga looks angrily while Minori uses her cute girl radar but picks up nothing. Ryūji and Kitamura watches on, and Kitamura explains how he’s never had a problem with her, he just wants her to have actual genuine friends being herself, and accepting that things might not go her way and not everyone will like her. Kitamura cares about Kawashima.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRyūji thinks about this, and as he heads to the vending machine, he meets up with Kawashima, trying to get him on her side to get back at Taiga. Ryūji’s tries not to fall to her tricks. She mentions meeting girls that just don’t like her, and she’s used to it. Ryūji’s doesn’t buy it, and he’s probably right since she can’t accept Taiga and she always tries to win everyone over. In 4th period, Taiga gives Ryūji a note asking why he was with Kawashima, she’s not too happy with him being with the chihuahua. He also gets a note from Kushieda, angry thinking he’s cheating on Taiga. She still sees Taiga and Ryūji as a couple no matter how much they deny it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter class is over, Ryūji is talking to best boys Noto and Haruta. They’re even inviting him to see some girls from the track team, but Ryūji’s got to attend to his girl instead. \[Toradora ep 23 spoilers\]>!Looking back, I guess it makes sense Haruta was able to get a girlfriend, Sena, since he was able to attract all these girls!<Taiga accidentally spilled what I presume to be milk on a locker. Ryūji cleans it and tells Taiga to go home if she wants, but she stays behind for him to finish. I like this brief moment. Shows how Taiga doesn’t want to leave Ryūji behind and alone. Most students probably would be out of the campus by the time he finished cleaning so he’d be all alone. Taiga patiently waits, and gets slightly happy when she thinks Ryūji is there, but unfortunately it's a different dog. Kawashima teases Taiga, saying how all the teachers dislike her, but Taiga doesn’t care and threatens her with stalking her, which hits home for Kawashima. Kawashima tries to threaten Taiga back with taking Ryūji away, but she doesn’t care either. Even if she may be jealous, she has seen Ryūji and knows he wouldn’t leave her all alone like that, and he probably won’t fall that easily for her. Kawashima isn’t ready to lose to Taiga so she threatens her with the knowledge that Kitamura “hates” her because of that incident. Seeing as how Kawashima is Kitamura’s childhood friend, Taiga would assume that as well. Ryūji enters and figures out something happened between the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey go home, and Ryūji serves some meat this time around, probably since Taiga complained last episode. Ryūji mentions that food tastes better off the stove, and that sentence starts off very similarly to what Yasu said in ep 2 (this is gonna turn into a metaphor i swear). He wants Taiga to enjoy and eat with them. So he checks up on Taiga with a blue hoodie on. As he noticed Taiga curled up and crying, he cheers her up and reassures her it’s gonna be okay, saying he knows everything. Taiga trusts Ryūji and believes him, and Ryūji adds Kitamura isn’t the type of person to hate her over something so stupid. But Taiga wonders though, if that’s the case, if he doesn’t hate her, why is she tiny and why does she have a weird name. This isn’t the stuff Kitamura hates about Taiga, but it’s the stuff Taiga hates about herself. However, she pounces back up because of Ryuji’s speech, though he kinda fumbles the bag when he mentions how it doesn’t matter that Kawashima’s been long friends with Kitamura, which earns him a pillow to the face because Taiga’s sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYasu interrupts and asks for some sauce. Now that they’ve resolved this issue, Taiga is able to help and get Ryuji to buy the sauce to make the food taste better. He and Taiga are able to properly enjoy the food since he motivated her to come for dinner, like their togetherness was the sauce, (that’s definitely a reach. Bravo takemiya!!! Another food metaphor!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n…Anyways they buy some sauce at what seems to be a knock-off 7/11. This area is a breeding ground for lawsuits, first Sudoh-Bucks, now Fm11. They figure out Kawashima has quit modeling. As the episode ends, they wonder why and they see her walking down the street with a bunch of junk food. Ryuji wonders if there’s a party, but Taiga, knowing what it’s like to feed off convenient store food for ages and eating a lot because of irritation, knows she’s stress-eating. Gives us a real hint at Kawshima’s isolation, and shows how she and Taiga might not be too different.Overall, a neat episode. It introduces us to Ami, who moves the plot forward a lot. Excited to dive deeper into the next episode!",1670742842,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izrdw4j/
izt6r30,zi3c0e,"First-timer, Dub\n\nThis episode was good. My favorite moment was when Ryuuji and Taiga both spat out their water as Yusaku and Ami walked in. They did a good job of building up to it by showing them taking big drinks simultaneously. \n\nI felt sad for Taiga because of how much Ami was able to tear her down, but at least we know that Ryuuji and Yusaku are not fooled. Hopefully Ryuuji continued to comfort her, beyond what we saw in the episode. \n\nI expect there will be some character development for Ami. She can't stay this evil the whole time. She'll probably remain the villain for a few episodes but then we'll get to see what's really going on with her, and then she'll be more sympathetic. I didn't know what to make of the end of the episode. All I could think was that she got all that junk food because she has some sort of eating disorder...\n\nThe dub cracked me up whenever Taiga would casually call Ami a bitch. I'm not used to that language in anime, and with Toradora's cute aesthetic and younger characters, there's a shock factor. The best moment was when Taiga and Ryuuji are walking and they notice Ami. Taiga shouts out, ""It's *the Bitch.""*  I'm not usually a fan of foul language, but this was funny.",1670781257,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izt6r30/

I really don't have high hopes for a proper anime adaptation especially when it would be made in a large part to cash in on the author's recent death. I hope some time passes and then a proper full adaptation is worked on. I currently feel like they wouldn't want to make another adaptation of the post-golden arc since 2016/2017 was recently made. Maybe in a couple of years when both the 2016/2017 adaptation and the movie trilogy are a bit older, we will get to see another adaptation that hopefully covers the entire series. Similar to how Hunter x Hunter, FMAB, and Shaman King took around a decade after their initial adaptations to get readapted. \n\nI think another couple of years will also really help the visual aspect of the Berserk adaptation. At this point in time, there is very little chance we would get an adaptation that doesn't have a large number of CGI monsters or large battles. CGI has been getting better quite quickly this last decade and I'm sure it will be even more impressive and well-integrated if the industry is given the proper time to really practice using and integrating it well.

izqkwiq,zi189x,"There's the influence of three factors that make that difficult for anyone now, but especially adults. First being that we got to experience things airing on TV which is an experience in itself to miss. Second being that it was quieter, something I don't mean in the sense of gatekeeping but just that the prospect of experiencing anime like it was an 'outside phenomenon' which wasn't as popular yet was also a certain type of experience that is no longer a thing in many countries now. And third which is exclusive to adults, is that nostalgia lies heavily in memories grappled from childhood, and less so from the ones made as adults.  \n\n\nThat said, at the very minimum, if I had to suspect or at least hope, I'll feel nostalgia with, it would have to be some things I experience in a unique way to how I normally would. Something that has memories linked to it outside just the experince of watching it plainly in my normal fashion. That can be anything. And with that logic, it's one I believe also entails the notion that everyone's 'nostalgic' series will be much more varied than in the past because of the enormous outpour of anime we get now. Moreso by the fact since nearly everyone watches whatever they want online, they're all watching different things.  \n\n\nThus far anything I watched even four years ago still feels very 'in the present' still. But on the offchance it DOES happen, then said animes I personally have specific memories tied to (and thus why these answers are random to anyone else):  \n\- Fruits Basket 2019  \n\- Case Study of Vanitas  \n\- Sk8 the Infinity",1670726767,t3_zi189x,/r/anime/comments/zi189x/what_new_anime_from_the_last_5years_will_give/izqkwiq/

And thanks for answering, honestly I've dropped Shield Hero I think after the first ""devil raid"" (pardon the term I didn't even remember properly), I didn't like the whole making an harem of slaves, it looked kind of predictable ? I know that the manga is very well considered, as the anime; could you tell me something more about what you've liked about it ? \n\nToradora the reason is kind of petty because I don't like the character design and animation, same question here what you've found interesting maybe also comparing with some other anime for reference !",1670788831,t1_iztlgw4,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/iztqkj5/
izwcnef,zi13pn,"Well I'm very glad to discover a lot of absolutely never heard anime for me, your description is very captivating, I don'tjnd being short or ongoing (cogh One Piece cogh HxH), I'm also intrigued by the use of black and white. I'm trying to go out my personal preferences and see different style of animation and character design so this is a welcome suggestion.

izp57kk,zi13pn,Thanks a lot for the great suggestions ! I was aware of World Trigger but didn't investigate enough ! \n\nOthers anime that I haven't watched or dislike that instead are worth watching ? An answer I get often is Code Geass for example,1670702995,t1_izp47fq,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/izp57kk/
iztvk6a,zi13pn,"In case you're curious they were called waves. One of the focuses is seeing how he starts to regain his humanity and his relationship with Raphtalia (the slave) plays a big part in this. I don't want to give too much away but things change for the better in a lot of ways. My friend was kind of in the same boat as you. I really recommend you watch it to at least episode 5 or 6. \nAs for Toradora the relationship building I guess is what I like but also the humor. There are some real tear jerker moments. Not that that's my thing but I appreciate a show that can really grab your heart. Tsuderes can bug me sometimes but Taigi (the short one) grows on you, or at least for me she did. Actually all the characters did. They can seem to be ridiculous at first but as they are developed they don't seem so bad.  \nI can't said for sure if you'd like Toradora if you watched more but I'd be surprised if you didn't end up liking Shield Hero.",1670790683,t1_iztqkj5,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/iztvk6a/
izpb7qi,zi13pn,"Yeah, scumbag Toei really hid World Trigger from the west by trying to mangle it the same way they mangled One Piece.  Luckily seasons 2 and 3 were seasonal with drastically higher animation budgets.  You will pass out from the tactical RPG stratagems that await you (I almost forget we are talking about a battle shounen).  Despite World Trigger not being known in the west, it's actually mad popular over in Japan thanks to the manga.\n\nAnother comedy gem is actually airing this very same season.  ""Bocchi the Rock"" might give you the impression of it being as bland as K-on, but episode 1 swiftly dispels your fears by presenting you with the most relatable and charismatic idiot with pink hair.  Watch episode 1 at least.\n\n There's more good anime that I can fit in a single reddit post, but I can try name dropping some of the niche anime I loved.  Prod me for details if you have questions of any particular ones.\n\n""Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Die Neue These"":  Polite gentleman fighting over control of the entire galaxy.\n\n""Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibouken"":  Most of the villains are protagonists.  Also comes with a ""generic"" protagonist to start with.\n\n""Wakfu"":  It's a french anime, with a french dub, and an episodic ""kid's cartoon"" start.  But the animation quality and tone of the story pivots into a very exciting and dramatic campaign with a wide variety of villains ranging from a madman clock-wizard to a reincarnated lunatic.  I found the fight animation in particular to be very fun to watch.  The show and game franchise are all the rage inside of France, but virtually unknown in the rest of the world.\n\n""Yowamushi Pedal"":  Happy, silly, and blood pumping goodness.\n\n""Kaiji the Ultimate Survivor"":  It has humans falling to their deaths from skyscrapers, fingers being cut off, foreheads being grilled, kidnapping, slavery, and best of all, the villains are literal monsters and STILL relatable.",1670705426,t1_izp57kk,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/izpb7qi/
izu13w0,zi13pn,"Thanks a lot for your answe, surprisingly I'm hooked to Toradora that was a great suggestion !! Will look into Rising of the Shield Hero too; fun fact I was so disgusted with the violence of Attack of Titan that I've never watched nor read anything and believe it or not I didn't even get spoilers, I just finished it (anime) two weeks ago and... Oh my god, the plot twist, the details of the world, the fighting scenes, the comradeship, the freaking thing that I can't say right now damn !!! \n\nAs mentioned above for other user feel free to DM me to ask anything about books, TV series and movies. Please write again something that could be obvious to you or that you've found in my list being neglected, really enjoy when I'm proven wrong.",1670792854,t1_iztvk6a,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/izu13w0/
j01ht7e,zi13pn,"EDIT: sorry in the new Reddit my answer wasn't linked to your post\n\nDamn World trigger definitely sounds like something I’ll enjoy ! Ahah I’ll pass out.\n\nI didn’t know about Bocchi either ! Pink hair sounds like that anime with the high school psychic guy that doesn’t talk (the disastrous life of “something”), huge missed opportunity because it would have added so much crazy and funny situations, like he comes up with absurd excuses to justify his powers etc. What about K-ON ? I’m always dubious in these kind of “young girl only anime” because I feel creepy lmao what do you think ?\n\nMan you’re on fire, polite guys who fight to rule the galaxy ? Sold immediately from the title ahah, I absolutely love comedy (huge fan of stand up comedian Louis CK, George Carlin, Chapelle, Ricky Gervais, Billy Connolly etc.)\n\nMmm I consider myself a gamer but sadly the Dragon Quest genre didn’t fit with my preferences, my max of Japanese genres is final fantasy and still I find it too boring (the turn based fight system). Still will look into it.\n\nWell I don’t mind French at all, I’m seeing a lot of great French graphic novels and if I’m not mistaken France is like the number one One Piece fan only after Japan, I’ll definitely look into this, would love to find European anime style series or movies.\n\nDamn you finished with two bangers that I too didn’t know, maybe the last one could be a little to much in term of violence, still will look into it.\n\nFantastic suggestions man, really appreciate if you want book, tv series or movies suggestions I’m pretty strong in that DM me !",1670932848,t1_izpb7qi,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j01ht7e/
j01zub2,zi13pn,"I wouldn't recommend K-On.  Mainly because of the complete lack of subversion/surprises, that particular show is exactly what it advertises, uneventful days of 4 highschool girls hanging out.\n\nI perceived it to be incredibly bland, and I watched it in its entirety (really long time ago).\n\nI also hate the Dragon Quest videogames, the anime won me over purely from the mangaka's writing (big amount of unexpected twists starting from the middle of the anime).  The plot of the anime does not seem to follow the games at all, but the story is rather generic in the first 20 episodes at least (likely to contrast with the later unconventional developments).\n\nNo problem at all, and thanks for the offer, I'll keep it in mind.",1670942194,t1_j01ht7e,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j01zub2/
j03egfx,zi13pn,"Thanks again for the response ! Yep I have a similar idea about K-ON, I think I'd rather watch the new music anime Bacchi (Beck was another incredible one of the same genre). \n\nAhah yes they war so repetitive and boring, I guess that for the kids that were born during those years were great but I think already with more ""complex"" ps1 title or pc for me it was a title that never had any appeal despite the really cool design of Toryama. Will consider it!",1670962157,t1_j01zub2,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j03egfx/
j03h9q8,zi13pn,"Just to add to your trivia.\n\nDragon Quest was actually the bastardization or simplification of the 'Wizardy"" franchise in an attempt to make the RPG videogames more accessible, easier to play, and therefore sell more units to increase profit in the japanese market (this was back when Japan only imported the overly awkward and complicated western RPGs and BEFORE any JRPGs existed).\n\nIn fact, MOST Fantasy or JRPGs, including your PS1 games likely descended from Dragon Quest (the first JRPG), which in turn was born from western Wizardry, which in turn came from Dungeons and Dragons, which in turn came from miniature wargaming (think plastic soldiers, measuring rulers, and lots of dice).\n\nDragon Quest is the definition of ""so intentionally casual and dumbed down that I want to kill myself"".\n\nExample article in case you ever feel like reading:  https://www.denofgeek.com/games/final-fantasy-first-jrpg-ever-genre-history/",1670963207,t1_j03egfx,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j03h9q8/
j0419m3,zi13pn,"Wow this is so cool ! Very interesting history of how we came to the first games (at least of this genre). I guess that in more methaporical terms we could start from our own imagination that would later be transformed into different types of medium (cards, minatures, D&D and games).\n\nAlways love some den of geek articles lmao \n\nNot that is related but it came to mind that I've become a gamer thanks to the first prince of Persia the sand of time, Tekken 3 and tomb raider (plus obviously the Pokémon nintendo Games).",1670970667,t1_j03h9q8,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j0419m3/
