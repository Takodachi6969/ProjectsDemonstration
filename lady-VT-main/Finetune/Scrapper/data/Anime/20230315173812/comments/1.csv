izq8d7x,zi7vno,"First timer, subbed\n\n  \nSo we've finished the infamous arc that supposedly ruined the show's reputation. I gotta say, it was definitely a bold move on the directors to do something like this, and I respect them for trying something new. Now, if I were keeping up this while it aired weekly, I'm sure I would be feeling a certain type of way. But the privileges of the internet allow me to binge it and analyze all the small differences from episode to episode, which I probably wouldn't have picked up on a week-to-week basis.   \nOne thing I find very cool about it is that they don't reuse any scenes, every shot is framed differently, even if it's the same events. If I were into filmmaking or cinematography, this would be a great resource for learning about those types of things. I like that they manage to stay creative in how they present things, such as the last scene in the 5th episode where the camera rotates with the ticking clock, which was pretty damn cool to me.  \nThe atmosphere is also different from episode to episode. Some episodes are lighter in tone, and some are downright unnerving at times.   \nI can't say I watched every second of every episode, because I value my time slightly more than that, but I did skim through using arrow keys to make sure I caught all the little details. I also wanted to make sure I heard all the music, too, because they used a bunch of new ones that I don't think I've heard before. The OST is pretty stellar, and I don't want to miss any.   \nSpeaking of music, I can only count a handful of times when I've skipped the OP or ED, but this is one of those times. Not because either of them are bad, in fact I quite like the emphasis between the music and the visuals, but I just don't think I can handle more monotony (even if the scenes aren't completely identical). I'll probably go back to listening to them afterwards, though.  \nAlso, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.  \nThere are a whole bunch of other miniscule differences I could write down, but they're not worth mentioning, and everyone has probably already noticed them, anyways.  \nNow did the ending make all of this worth it? ... I'm not sure about that. I feel like more could have been done or built up over the eight episodes to create a more satisfying conclusion. What we got wasn't bad, and implies something more to Haruhi and Kyon's relationship I guess, but I felt like it could have been more ... climactic? It just didn't feel like it was worth eight episodes of monotony. Maybe if it were two or three. All in all though, it was a pretty interesting idea, and I don't regret the experience, but there's no way in hell I'll ever do this again.\n\nQOTD: Procrastination hasn't bitten me in the ass (yet) but it has given me a decent amount of stress the night before.",1670720431,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq8d7x/

Its peak hatred was as it was airing in 2009, likely in part due to how KyoAni chose to air Season 2 (which you can learn more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7k3oec/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya_day_16/drbb8hm/)). It even got the Season 1 director, who had no part in the creation of season 2, to [issue an apology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqy8x-zKuKw) due to the backlash it got.  Endless Eight was not originally meant to be shown in this fashion though. From a roundtable meeting in 2010, Fumihiko Shimo, scriptwriter for both the TV show and *Disappearance*, discussed how *Disappearance* was originally an 7 episode arc meant to be a part of S2. \n\n> **Shimo:** That's already a tale from long ago. (laughs) In June of 2007 was when we first started. At\nthat time we had plans to make Disappearance part of a TV season.\n\nInstead, the script ballooned so much in size that it was instead decided that *disappearance* should be split into its own movie instead to give it a proper adaption, and even then it was cut down from what script supervisor Tatsuya Ishihara wanted.\n\n> **Ishihara:** And while we’re speaking of wants, I actually wanted it to be a bit longer. There were more scenes I wanted to include in this work. We made Melancholy six episodes but we still had to cut down the original work considerably.\n\nThe roundtable doesnt go into any discussion as to why EE was chosen though. The easiest guess is that future content relied on Disappearance happening before they could be animated (and while i havent read the LN's fully yet, i know this is true for at least [Haruhi LN story title]>!Snowy Mountain!<). I dont have much more to speculate on why this was chosen though.",1670716969,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq196w/

izq1rag,zi7vno,"**Stuck In A Time Loop (don't tell Haruhi)** \n\nSo! I have a confession to make. I've never really cared about watching anime just as it comes out, especially not when I had to sail the high seas to watch anything at all, so by the time I watched season two of Haruhi Endless Eight was already a known thing. \n\nSo I skipped most of it. \n\nThis is the first time I have watched all eight episodes, and honestly? Having done it once, I don't think I'll ever do it again. Which is a damn shame, because Endless Eight could - and should! - have been absolutely *amazing*. \n\nI knew the story going in. I've watched Haruhi before, and I've read the original story this arc is based on. But at the end of the third episode, I was still hit by a wave of genuine *dread* over the situation the characters were in. It *worked*. \n\nAnd then episode four ended. And episode five. And on, and on, and *on*. And that feeling of dread morphed into 'why isn't this over yet?' \n\nIn my personal opinion - and I know plenty of people in this rewatch disagree, more power to you if you enjoyed the full arc - KyoAni's **only** mis-step with Endless Eight was making it last a full eight episodes. If they'd ended it after four, or maybe five at a stretch, I think it would be seen as some of the best storytelling in the series instead of being the thing that nearly killed it. \n\nStill! It's not only doom and gloom. The artists quite gleefully supplied a variety of different outfits for all the main characters, and I've always appreciated it when anime studios take the time and effort to expand characters' wardrobes. They really didn't spare any effort for Endless Eight, and made sure all of the episodes were unique instead of just copy-pasting. Different camera angles, changing where the characters were or went during the different events, focussing on separate aspects each time...KyoAni put a *lot* of work into this arc. \n\nI just wish it didn't outstay its welcome.",1670717210,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq1rag/

izqlbab,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n**DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY.  ONE EPISODE REMAINS.**\n\n- More cicadas!\n- Oh THAT’S a fun little overhead panning shot at 00:05: it uses a concave lens in order to show the warping of time, making everything look kind of like something closed in on itself.\n- OST use good again this episode.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Color palette and the plant out of focus in the foreground at 00:45 gives a washed-out feeling to the shot, similar to E8-2.\n- The baserunner’s expression at 01:13 is probably going to be foreshadowing for Kyon at the end of this final loop.\n- Ants carrying away the wings of a dead cicada at 01:21.  That’s unlikely to be just a scene; we are reaching the end of the cicadas, and likewise the endless summer.  Especially when it’s overlaid over Kyon’s line about how summer is already over.\n- Right, there are exactly eight characters in Endless Eight’s name.  Should have noticed it earlier, this episode makes it easy.  Sasuga Nagaru Tanigawa!  (Also I think they may be back to normal writing, another hint that this is the final loop.)\n- Haruhi has best outfit here at the first meetup today, Mikuru’s doesn’t quite flatter her.  (Koizumi keeps getting disqualified for looking too prep, Kyon doesn’t give a rat’s ass.)\n- Dutch angle for the “summer should be like summer, so we have to do summer activities” line? That’s a new one for this loop.  Also it focuses the camera on Haruhi’s crotch (might be more than just fanservice, ulterior motives for spending time with Kyon go!), but we get a little something for everyone – Kyon’s position and the way his clothes bag emphasize his ass as well.\n- Quick cuts for deja vu, I do believe.\n- Pan down to beach ball… cut to Haruhi’s beachballs.  Heh.\n- Also, FINAL LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: orange side-tie bikini (pretty sure it counts and isn’t just a two piece) for Haruhi, frilly pink polka-dotted one piece with skirt for Mikuru (shouldn’t work on her but does, but I think Haruhi probably has the better suit this loop), green one-piece with a light green vertical stripe down the front for Yuki (she may have worn this one before actually), blue long swim trunks with a white stripe down each side for Koizumi, teal long swim trunks with a cyan-ish vertical stripe down from where the pockets are/would go for Kyon.  (It’s the important things in life.)\n- Okay, props to Sugita Tomozaku for his delivery of the “restrain yourself!  Can’t you read the No Diving sign?” at around 04:00.  (It’s deeper than his usual Kyon voice and I think that’s intentional for humor; it works.)\n- What’s that, screentime of two boys with well-defined physiques that focuses on their chests?  See, the fanservice is equal-opportunity today!\n- Well well well well.  There’s a sneaky little shot: Yuki floating down the pool on the front of the screen towards the left but looking right around 04:43, with the camera focusing more on Haruhi and Mikuru in the background so you might not notice.  Yuki is moving into the future but still focusing on the past, then?\n- 04:47: sore demo alert!\n- Bored Yuki continues to be very bored.\n- 05:42: Note Yuki sitting in the shade while both Koizumi and Kyon sit in the sunlight.  Welcome to the melancholy of Yuki Nagato.  (Also this plus Japanese reading the screen right to left might be setup for [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]; I’m actually quite reminded of something in the visuals for Colorful from Rebellion.)\n- Oooh, 05:55.  We get sepia for Kyon looking at Yuki (sepia being the tone of flashbacks, visual indicator of deja vu), but also notice Kyon being framed in light here as he notices – he’s seen the metaphorical light by noticing Yuki.\n- Haruhi following this up by moving so that her shadow covers Kyon thus blocking him from the light is also interesting.  (Was the animator for this scene a Kyon/Yuki shipper?  Could just be Haruhi and her force of personality blocking out Kyon thinking about the deja vu.)\n- Fish-eye lens at 06:32.  (Also Mikuru’s outfit does work better on her in this light.)\n- And oh would you look at that, Kyon is still in the offset seat to the side that he was in last episode but that Yuki was in in all episodes before that.  Funny that.  More on that… later.  ([CLASSIFIED INFORMATION])\n- (Note to self: Broadcast order post-2009 would probably actually work better if you switched the positions of Sighs and E8.)\n- Haruhi’s outfit ALSO works better on her in this light.  Gorgeous isn’t quite the right word; “you look extremely attractive in this, Haruhi” is about right.\n- Sad bored Yuki just looking at her drink at 07:30.  (Hug.  Hug.  Hug.)\n- Just showing the hand gesture for Haruhi waving everyone free?  I don’t actually know what to make of that.\n- In this final loop Yuki leaves in the same direction as everyone else, off towards the left… oh, that’ll be final loop foreshadowing again, they all get to go off into the future after this.\n- Ooh, Yuki blink as she (white lies and) tells Kyon she’s all right.  Note how we didn’t get many Yuki blinks in the early episodes but we are getting them late?  Funny that.\n- Extremely low-angle shot of Kyon and his shadow at 08:12 as he wonders why he called out to her. The shadow faces right; just the long shadow of past loops then?\n- It’s between Yuki and Haruhi for best yukata today and it’s close (though not like Mikuru’s is bad, but while part of me thinks it goes great the other part thinks the shade of yellow – or possibly white colored by the lighting – is just a little wrong for her), but shout to Kyon, that olive vest he’s wearing actually works for him IMO even if it’s a little too loose.\n- This loop’s Yuki mask: an alien one to end the cycle.  This could not be a metaphor, no never.  It’s not like the entire point of this is that the artificial human Yuki is increasingly a real human just wearing an alien mask, no never.  (Also remember that alien as representing the autism spectrum is a take with a long vintage.)\n- OST cutoff as Kyon resolves to ask Haruhi about her homework.  (Quiet point I should have remembered/thought of earlier: Kyon asking about this is probably his him hinting that he’d like to do homework with everyone.  I know you get this same kind of subtle hinting when it comes to Japanese dating.)\n- Also yes, funny that they make sure to keep the homework lines in every episode, yes?\n- Fanservice for everyone; now we get a subtle Yuki butt focus shot at 10:30.\n- See also: Haruhi positioned in the montage shot at 10:39 so that her own butt and her legs are centered in the screen.  And Mikuru falling right after that in a way that emphasizes *her* ass.\n- Yuki rhinoceros beetle catch GET!\n- Also LOL at Haruhi catching Mikuru while going for another cicade at 10:42.\n- Well well well, would you look at that.  One cicada actually came back this time, even landing on the net.  Why, they did return the favor!  Another indicator this is the FINAL ~~LAP~~ LOOP.\n- Another day, another good Haruhi casual outfit this loop at 11:45.\n- Huh.  Different framing at 12:19, with us seeing Kyon straight from the side looking towards the wall but to our eyes looking towards the window.  Actually reminds me of Shaft style somehow.  Also he’s looking into the past, I suppose.\n- Props to the subbers for trying to get across Mikuru’s blubbering here!\n- PROTECC THE MIKURU AND THE YUKI.\n- Yuuko Gotou outdid herself this time around I see (and, more importantly, hear).\n- Well well well well.  What have we here, two moths fluttering around a lit streetlamp.  This is A Thing in Japanese cinematography, though I forget exactly what it means.  (I’m used to associating it with impending death, but that’s not the case here.  Impending doom maybe, where the doom is the loop?)\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time!”\n- The choice of framing Koizumi by his folded arms and legs at 13:46 is notable.  I don’t think that’s fanservice, but I’m not sure what the point is.  (He’s hiding some of his thoughts?)\n- Note all four of them in a group framed facing left/towards the future at 14:23, unlike past loops.\n- Nice shot of the shadows on the floor at 14:35 as Koizumi talks about Haruhi having lingering regrets/something she wants to do, a metaphorical shadow over the proceedings.  But in fact there is a deeper layer here, since the real issue is another metaphorical shadow over the proceedings: the impending doom of homework looming over Kyon.\n- Butterfly or moth at 14:44, more time loop symbolism I do believe.  (But now fluttering to the left into the future, hmm?)\n- Note the trash can with its lid ajar off to the side at 14:53… and unlike the other version of this scene where we got this, this time the open can is the one to the left.\n- Also note how quickly this version of this scene is progressing relative to previous ones.  I wonder why?\n- Welllll then.   Note 15:10… where Koizumi gestures *towards the screen* while talking about how one person remembers everything.  He’s talking about Yuki… but he is gesturing towards you the viewer, who also remember everything of the last eight episodes.  (This entire adaptation choice is about putting you in Yuki’s shoes.)\n- “Who is that?”  The person whose eyes are out of frame (not just hidden) when you ask that at 15:12, Kyon.  I like visual answers!  And visual answer cuts too, and we get one of those right after with the cut to Yuki’s face.\n- Ooof, Yuki’s expression and hidden eyes at 15:31.\n- REACTION SHOT!  Wide eyes and then the can dropping to the ground!  (And the can starts spinning in a loop, heh.  But note: it spins *clockwise*.)\n- And then a blatant Dutch angle immediately after this for more emphasis.\n- LOTS of Dutch angles, now with fish-eye lens as well at 15:57.\n- Can on the ground remains blunt loop symbolism… oh, but it’s also Yuki’s silent cry for help (second episode of this arc with this motif), heh.  “I have no mouth and I must scream.”",1670726980,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqlbab/
izqy8rx,zi7vno,"We get Koizuma in a hilariously cursed speedo, Haruhi's ass, (Everyone's ass actually.)\n\nI like the shot with the clock and the screen is rotating around it one episode, another one where the street light is framing in the shot as the loop is being explained again.\n\nOne thing I want to point out. (u/ZapsZzz will appreciate this.) Is when Koizumi and Kyon are talking about romancing Haruhi to try to break the loop, Mikaru and Haruhi are asleep (Its very cute how they sleep together too.) But Nagato is awake and hearing the whole thing, if we accept she also has a crush on Kyon how do you think this conversation makes there feel especially with them saying it as if it doesn't matter that she is there?\n\nNotice on the Last Loop they have the OG swimsuits from the Mystery Island Arc.\n\nKyon finally figures it out and you have to love his overblown melodramatic reaction from his revelation, and how from Haruhi's perspective (since she doesn't know about the loop) He's lost his damn mind. Also how despite the fact she is finished with her homework she wants to come to.\n\nIt really does show she is spoiled but has a kind side, she wanted to set aside a day and didn't want summer to end until she was sure Kyon was done with his homework. (And perhaps the others as well.)\n\nI've been told by LN stans in the comments that in the Novels Haruhi does do more to help then play video games while they are all studying.\n\nIt also shows that she does have a limited perspective and why she is a bit of a spoiler and naive bratt, She is super smart and doesn't have to try, athletic, has a forceful personality, lots of energy, is an S tier beauty, can be quite charming when she wants, she has the whole world in the palm of her hand, is good at everything she tries, and very few things challenge her, and yet while others would see her as living the dream and best life you can live, due to her existential dread it all doesn't mean anything to her. (Or at least it doesn't until she meets Kyon and the S.O.S Brigade.) It's very hard for her to understand and empathize with others due to her outlook and talent, and in turn its hard for others to connect with her.\n\nKyon might be annoyed with her, and see her as a bit of a nuisance, but he also (even within the club) is the only one that actually....well *sees* **Her.** And not see her as a God, Beast, or Natural Disaster, Just a Human Being (Albeit an annoying bitch of one.) And despite seeing how much of a pain she is and understanding what she is capable of. (Both mundane and supernatural.) He gives her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nQOTD: I'm like Haruhi I never procrastinate and get things done as soon as possible to get it out of the way.",1670733728,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqy8rx/
izt45a4,zi7vno,"**First Timer Sub**\n\nKind of caught up now, just gotta watch today's episode...\n\nI can see why this angered people when it came out, there's not really any excuse for why this had to be a full 8 episodes, but at least it's over with now.\n\nAs expected, Haruhi just wanted to feel like she actually had friends with wants and the homework was the way to kill two birds with one stone. I would've liked it if we got some sort of build-up for it though. The solution was pretty obvious from the get-go and then it all wrapped up in a matter of minutes at the end. I know it's not what they were going for, but in any other show Kyon, Koizumi, and Mikuru would probably start trying to get out of the situation after their initial middle of the night meet-up. Instead they just gave up and moped around with Koizumi thinking of a single solution and not pushing it, Mikuru not trying at all, and Kyon only ever trying at the very last moment (fitting for the whole procrastination thing I guess). Nagato gets a pass because her orders are just to observe, but since she is willing to answer questions I'm surprised no one bothered asking her questions each time. Like, surely most people would think to ask things aloing the lines of:\n\nHey Nagato, what have we previously tried?\n\nThis one question each time would have caught them up to speed and progressed the situation, so it's frustrating to see all three of them do nothing.\n\nAlso, given the no-diving signs, I wonder if the two times they ended up not going to the festival were because Haruhi injured herself diving.\n\n**QOTD**\n\nI procrastinated in high school a lot, but I still always gave myself enough time to finish the work, and in college there wasn't really room for procrastinating, cause there was always a lot of work to do, most of which I couldn't give a good time estimate on before starting.",1670780229,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izt45a4/

izscj56,zi7vno,"First-timer:\n\nI must be a masochist, because I watched all eight episodes. \n\nI am torn. I understand the concept. It's like we're suffering the same way Nagato did, and I liked all the subtle differences in each episode. Doing it once on a weekly basis probably was better, because there'd be build up and then you're right back where you started, instead of marathoning all 8 episodes in the span of 2 days. \n\nBut man, it was starting to get painful after episode 4. I don't think I'll rewatch all 8 episodes again, or at a minimum do all 8 in 2 days. I think they could have gotten away with cutting that in half. \n\nAs for the ending, I figured it had to do with homework based on the quote and emphasizing it at the end of each episode. Haruhi assumed everyone had their homework done, because she doesn't really understand that people think differently than her (besides maybe Kyon), and in her mind summer can't be enjoyed unless it's done. She probably picked up on Kyon not enjoying things fully because he had not finished his homework, and figured he wasn't truly enjoying summer like she had, and wanted him to feel satisfied with no regrets about summer. \n\nAnd that's what it keeps going back to. She comes off very egomaniacal, but she clearly cares about Kyon a lot, and his obliviousness (or maybe refusal?) to indulge triggers these ridiculous situations. \n\nQuestion:\n\nNot sure if this counts as homework, but I put off doing a grad school application until the last minute, and then because I overslept the deadline to get the transcript from my college, I missed being able to put in the application for my top choice.",1670768350,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izscj56/
izqjz82,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- Clouds again, also a tilted unlit lantern (going left, heh) to emphasize that something is wrong.\n- Discarded cicada nymph shell, probably yet more references to a certain other work.\n- 00:22 is deliberate and has to be for effect.  The interesting thing is the camera on the phone pointing at you the viewer when Haruhi represents the show and Kyon represents audience and author – the show looking to see what Tanigawa will do and what your reactions to it will be?\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- This is not as well directed and my hand is complaining about last episode’s writeup so imma slack a bit.  Still, 00:27 sticks out too – off angle emphasizing the offness of the situation, probably.\n- 00:46 with the phone would probably have more of a point if I could read moonrunes.  Though really part of that is the name and the other part is probably just length of call so.  Note the subtle zoom, and the cut to a cloud screensaver (clouds again!) right afterwards.\n- Yet more cloud emphasis with the pan to the clouds outside as Kyon talks about how summer’s already over (once again).\n- More nifty tricks with the Endless Eight title card.\n- Shot of Kyon looking at his feet to shot disorientation again (I think) at 03:04.\n- (Bored Yuki is still bored but the counter is suspended for the sake of my hand.)\n- Welp, 03:29.  Haruhi knows what she’s doing.  Also, since Kyon is the audience her resting her breasts on his head probably has a meta point – Haruhi the show is kind of doing the same thing to the audience.  (Reinforced by the pan to her face looking right at the screen as she starts talking to Kyon.)\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: Striped red two-piece for Haruhi, frilly cyan/light blue one-piece for Mikuru, stock school swimsuit for Yuki (old flap style one I think?), long olive trunks for Kyon… OH SHIT IT’S THE SPEEDO EPISODE (but only for Koizumi, thought it was both).  That’ll win him Best Swimsuit today I think, especially with the other swimsuits all being meh except maybe Mikuru’s (it does not look bad on her at all).\n- (I just had the mental image of a Haruhi/Bikki teamup.  THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED.)\n- Quick pan today to represent Koizumi’s deja vu at the world-altering events line.\n- Extremely obvious butterfly shot at 04:40, that’ll be the repurposing of the Butterfly of Death and Rebirth for time loops again.  (Also they’re even more obvious about how bored Yuki is this episode.)\n- LOL Mikuru belly flop.  (Also the frills are specifically just a skirt.)\n- Kyon noticed the bored Yuki!  (Also there’s some Dutch angles around, but that counter is in abeyance as well.)\n- 05:30 is another “this probably has more meanings if you can read moonrunes” shot.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~5:05 P.M. I think?)\n- Concave lens for the eatery scene introduction this time.\n- Mikuru’s casual outfits have been on point this episode so far.\n- Note the lack of a visible exit sign so far this time; we all know at this point we’re here for the long haul.\n- Never mind, there it is at 06:29.  But it’s small and out of focus in the distance, so same effect.\n- HNNNGH that look on Yuki’s face at 07:03.  (A key part here is that Kyon is the only person who checks in on her and she recognizes that, even if I think she’s also somewhat irritated that he keeps doing this without realizing it.)\n- 07:09 is blatant: visual separation via Kyon walking away, he actually came over to check in on her world but is now walking back away from it.  (And it’s where we get the crows cawing, too.)\n- The festival clearly being held in a baseball stadium this time around draws a direct comparison line to the baseball game on TV at the start of the loop.\n- Sepia filter for Kyon stating that he gets the feeling he owes her, heh.\n- Oh, that’s because it’s shot through the eye of the mask for this loop (another robot/tokusatsu one), giving us a really meat transition at 08:12.\n- Yeah, they’re probably supposed to be fireworks particles, but something about the effect at ~08:43 is making me go “dango, dango, dango, dango, dango daikazoku…”  (specifically by comparison to a shot at the end of that ED).\n- LOL Yuki looking right at Mr. Hasn’t Done His Homework.\n- Hello reflection shot at 09:41.\n- That confirms it’s a statue at the park.  (Fountain centerpiece I think.)  Also even more gathering thunderclouds (the incident is brewing again).\n- Strange beetle.

Also Yuki knows it’s not a cicada by now so is probably showing off for Kyon, no?\n- Or maybe not the same, this time Kyon namedrops the Yanbaru scarab.\n- Datto shitemo alert!  (Sucks to be Sky.)\n- Panning shot at 10:19 flashes.  Because panorama maybe?\n- It IS the Eva reference episode!

Haruhi wants to take the frog costume home with her!!!!” joke for five episodes now, let’s fix that.\n- WATCH WATCH.\n- Extremely huggable Yuki at 11:35.\n- Kyon responding to the phone with “the number you have dialed is not [currently in service]” before cutting himself off because Mikuru this time around is a nice touch.\n- A second use this episode of the phone receiving screen for effect.  Must be a point to that.\n- Huh, a shot of delinquents at 12:15 that’s new to this episode.  Not sure what’s up with that, could just be setting the scene though.\n- We get an unnaturally saturated color palette to show the strangeness of the situation this time around.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~1:52 A.M.)  Now with another time loop butterfly, that makes three uses so far this episode.\n- Yuki sitting hunched on the ground in near-fetal position along with Mikuru is another subtle show of her deteriorating mental state.\n- WATCH WATCH.  (Same time I think, also the design represents the loops because of course.)\n- MUST… HUG… AND… COMFORT… YUKI…\n- Props to Yuuko Gotou for her rendition of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line here, that was well-acted.\n- Oh shit Mikuru is wearing dolphin shorts, isn’t she?  I approve!\n- 15:23 flashes; again, Japanese film culture has a thing about power lines.\n- At a meta level, note the “all deja vu is the result of remembering similar events in past lives” reincarnation take.  (Actual Western occultism (not sure about Eastern) doesn’t tend to agree with this, amusingly enough, despite belief in reincarnation also being common there; instead the common theory there goes off the astral plane concept and posits that time does not flow linearly at that level so events in the future can be remembered in the past… which actually also isn’t that far from our time loop here, come to think of it...)\n- Okay Mikuru is also looking extremely huggable at 15:59.\n- Hey, Kyon realized who Koizumi was talking about without needing to be told!  (As reinforced by centering Yuki in the middle of the screen here, focusing your attention on her a second before he speaks up.)  And look at Yuki moving her eyes to look at Kyon as he asks about this.\n- Yuki blink!\n- Holy shit that piano track that fires up after 15,521 works well here.  Sad, emotional, almost tragic, it fits the mood they’re going for perfectly.\n- Shit, I almost missed Mikuru being shocked as well.\n- More blinks.  Keep an eye on that, it might be a visual representation of Yuki slowly getting more human.\n- Hey look, he has a calculator to do the math this time!  (I can actually get close through mental math via shortcuts – 15,498 the original end loop being close to 15,600 which is 600 x 26 (26 two-week periods in a year) exact helps and I did mental math competitions in school back in the day – but not precisely.)\n- And we have FINALLY ticked up to 595 years.\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- HNNGH 18:28 HUG THE YUKI.\n- Also a blunt visual separation shot right after at 18:33.\n- 18:47 because Yuki thinks of herself as an observer (much like that telescope, which might be why she keeps looking through it earlier in addition to looking where it points here) and also a slightly panoramic shot which might be intended to give the impression of an IMAX planetarium.\n- Huh, airplane.  (Also Yuki remains infinitely huggable and infinitely in need of hugs or some other kind of emotional support.)\n- Huh, we get the observer line during the test of courage this time instead of during baseball.  I actually like that choice, this is in many ways Yuki’s emotional test (far beyond what she ever should have had to handle).\n- The thundercloud at 19:55 is more developed than earlier in the episode, which will indicate the gathering metaphorical storm as we approach August 31.\n- Another stadium shot at 20:10, again calling back to the game at the beginning.\n- Another episode with a sore de and then a sore demo (20:21), wouldn’t be surprised if that’s actually in the original LN.\n- The rotating playground thing whose name I forget at 20:29 is another blunt visual metaphor; note the rotation is counterclockwise and Haruhi is pushing it, which is extremely obvious and almost certainly has nothing to do with Great Mandala movements at all in this case.  (Haruhi is after all literally turning the clock back!)\n- And I typed that BEFORE they started rotating the world around the nearly stationary playground equipment towards the end of that shot.\n- Kyon drawing that infinity-looking eight at 20:42 is the bluntest thing in the world.  “You have realized we’re doing this for the full eight episodes by this point, right?”\n- Okay, Koizumi has best swimsuit this episode but Mikuru wins best casual outfit in a walk, she has like three really good ones this episode including this last one here at 20:51.",1670726295,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqjz82/
izqkjbu,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- This episode seems to like quick cuts for effect – the cicada flash at 00:04, the yield sign (unless Japan didn’t borrow the upside-down-triangle-means-yield convention) at 00:07, the stream at 00:09. (Also I heard crows cawing in the background briefly.)  Another means of representing disorientation, and the first two at least have symbolism relevant to time loops.\n- Kyon only wearing an undershirt here at the start might be a reference [meta spoiler] >!Higurashi is a possibility, though Keiichi’s vest in DEEN form is different!<.\n- Good shadow usage at 00:30.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Facial animation looks better than usual this episode.\n- Okay, that’s the best opening title card yet.  Infinity symbol Endless Eight is on point.\n- Also, Haruhi your fashion sense is off today.  (Koizumi looks average, so Mikuru will take this in a walk.)\n- LOL Kyon holding the inflatable whats-it-called over his shoulder as he goes “well I suppose that makes sense with these preparations”.  More “no shit” than usual, that’s a straight-up visual gag I think.\n- Kyon is a target today!\n- I really should probably note how each half of each episode after the first is structured so that the first half has Kyon receiving a phone call and then going to this park, just with the time of day inverted.\n- Oh wait, Koizumi has the inflatable instead of Kyon.  (Also Yuki is bored, but count still suspended.)\n- Haruhi’s head in the foreground blocking Mikuru’s face in the background at 03:46 is also an interesting shot choice.  I’d say another “no, don’t look at her, look at me!” but Haruhi’s not really visible either.\n- 04:02: Mikuru is cute!  (Yuki is still bored.)\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: Haruhi: halter-top baby blue bikini with red, yellow, and white hearts on it (props for the design, massive minus points for the colors clashing with her); Mikuru: pastel rainbow bikini/two-piece with a front tie on the top and a skirt on the bottom; Yuki: competition swimsuit; Kyon: long red trunks; Koizumi: medium blue trunks with a white design on them.  I think Mikuru wins this one still, but Yuki actually comes quite close, that competition swimsuit works on her.\n- The quick cuts are in fact this episode’s way of showing disorientation/deja vu.\n- Also LAMP LAMP in the background at the pool, not sure it was visible in any prior episode.\n- Yuki is at least swimming!  Good for her.  (Except… there might actually be more to it.  Water can symbolize emotions… and we’ve seen Yuki getting into the water more and more over the course of these episodes, joining the always emotional Haruhi and Mikuru.  Funny that.)\n- Cute Yuki at 05:20.  (The thing about this episode’s Yuki is that she doesn’t look quite as bored as she has in the last three and she probably should be.)\n- Never mind, there we go, bored look back at 05:23.\n- Wait, Mikuru’s swimsuit is another halter-top!  That’ll win her Best Swimsuit today from me.\n- Fanservice ho!\n- Muting out the music as Kyon looks at Yuki’s boredom is a good audio touch.\n- I’ll go ahead and note that Dutch angle at 06:02, the episode is using it as the “something is wrong” visual cue here.\n- Poor Mikuru.\n- And now we see Mikuru with a heating or cold pad on her face in the restaurant at 06:30; nice touch!\n- Yuki’s never been out of the side chair IIRC for reasons I explained yesterday, but 06:41 draws attention to it well.\n- Exit sign never shows up here either, they know you know it’s not ending this episode.\n- Return of the power lines!\n- Yuki moving left again at 07:28; not the first time we’ve seen her moving to the left (future) as Kyon catches up to check on her.\n- Ooh, THAT’S noteworthy.  Note the tree in front of Yuki at 07:31 when she stops to turn towards Kyon; Kyon is blocking her path to the future.  (Do the fucking homework, Kyon!  Also might have more to say, but I think I’d rather not talk about that until I can admit a point from Disappearance which might be relevant.)  Also note her facial expression; it looks almost irritated as she closes her eyes right before she turns to face him.\n- 07:35 is a visual box shot with slightly different symbolism; Kyon has entered the box (the little trapped loop world) Yuki is in to check up on her.\n- And then the cut at 07:48 means that Yuki’s head *becomes* the tree, interesting.  Might have an idea there, but again I want that Disappearance point in evidence for that.\n- 07:54: HNNNGH MUST HUG THE YUKI.  (She almost looks concerned to me there… and then right back to looking irritated from the side as we cut back to the box frame.  Also cue the crows.)\n- Haruhi was saving her fashion sense for the yukata I see; the color coordination (same main color, different secondary colors) works perfectly, yukata winner today is all three as a unit because they are more than the sum of their parts.\n- Kyon wearing a sigma T-shirt.  Probably supposed to be a math joke knowing this show (infinite sum), but there’s a meme joke to be made here that couldn’t have been intended since said meme postdates this series by at least half a decade, probably twice that.  (Or I could make an ancient Greece joke, IIRC Spartans were reputed for using shields with a sigma printed on them.)\n- Oh right there’s the other Eva reference, there are subtle Unit-02 and Unit-00 references in the colors of two of the mask types today.\n- Was half-expecting Yuki to go for the Unit-00 mask because obvious Rei expy is obvious, but no it’s another robot mask.  (Same symbolism as it’s had for several episodes now, Yuki’s robotic demeanor is a mask by now.)\n- … ooookkkaaay, so Mikuru really can rock a ponytail if she wants to.  [](#towel)\n- And in turn an extremely cute Haruhi att 11:14 (that facial expression plus that yukata just works). Also I think she’s bouncing her breasts a bit to appeal to Kyon.\n- PFFFFT Koizumi is wearing a safari park ranger getup for the cicada hunt.  (Meanwhile Mikuru is wearing a farmer’s overalls/shirt/hat.  You know, she could probably try the proverbial sack too, she’d probably rock it just fine.)\n- Dutch angles for the cicada-catching competition montage.  Something is amiss!  (Again.)\n- Ah, more higurashi cries.\n- Huh, fan in the supermarket office is CGI.  Obvious enough this time (12:28).\n- Okay, what mecha is Adzam Leader from?\n- Well, Haruhi’s tank top at 12:35 works on her, at least.\n- Huh.  Mikuru uses “atashi”.  Never noticed that before.  Might be a hint that at least some of her moeblobness is an act, actually.\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time!”\n- The visual separation this time around is really strange, with Koizumi separated consistently from both Kyon and Mikuru.  Possibly because the espers have done the research and neither of them really have?\n- Something about the VA performance and/or animation for Mikuru during this version of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line.  She doesn’t quite manage to land being distraught enough (which is the idea, she’s blabbing without heed and getting filtered by a verbal censor).\n- “When the loop starts over, we won’t remember ever having this conversation.”\n- Koizumi and Yuki in the same visual box at 17:02 because they’re the two with better info on the situation, Yuki separated from the other three because she remembers, got it.\n- 18:27: Good shadow usage, also PROTECC THE YUKI.\n- Another Dutch angle for disorientation.\n- Rotating shot at ~19:10 is the flashiest of the episode so far (counterclockwise because literally against the clock).\n- Oof that zoom-out on Yuki at 19:36.\n- You know, this show knows about Sisyphus.  Kyon walking his bike up the road at ~19:53 might be symbolism of the same kind: moving the bike up the hill to try to get past the crest (August 31), but implicitly he does not manage it.\n- Ooh, twinkling stars!\n- This loop Yuki brings a book to the roof, I see.\n- Mikuru still not swinging at baseballs I see… wait I take that back, she actually does try!  She’s improving!  (Just a little.)  (But does she want to improve at this specifically?  That is the question.)\n- LOL we get Haruhi sleeping on Yuki for a change.\n- Exit sign visible this time at the final restaurant meeting.\n- Does Haruhi manage to snipe best outfits this episode after all?  She’s come on strong late (and Mikuru’s outfits have stagnated).\n\n---\n\n> What's the biggest problem procrastinating on your homework has given you\n\nThere's a couple of classes in college where I just ate a lost point of GPA rather than do the homework.",1670726581,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkjbu/
izqkzkm,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- Uh-oh, direction is back in shape, I might have to put in more effort.  Also, nice August 8 start there, and nice use of the tape dispenser to represent the loop at 00:08.  Also the Rule of Three repetition of “strange” (“okashi”) before starting up the usual opening line (“something was strange”).  It’s like a film projector or a record player skipping… which is probably another part of the tape dispenser shot, too.\n- The OST for this scene works very well to set the mood, too.\n- Oh right, the stuttering is also just visual/audio representation of deja vu.  Duh.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Also nice use of shadows with the light from the TV screen shining over the unnaturally dark room (also mirrors E8-2 in a way, but not in others).  It’s like the TV screen is the only source of light on the situation – which might be meta, the events on screen are the only light at the end of the tunnel that was the E8 fan experience.\n- There might be deeper meaning to the couch shot around 01:25… separation since Imouto doesn’t remember anything and is just blindly watching events new to her while Kyon has faint past memories? Hmm, with the TV here might be a meta angle – oh right, we the viewer are via the POV further removed from the TV (the surface image of the world) than either Imouto or Kyon, since we remember everything.  (And then there’s Yuki watching the TV from a lightyear behind us…)\n- Aww the title is just a small ring this time.\n- You wouldn’t think Haruhi’s outfit here would work on her, but it does.  (A bit hot though I would think.)  Also give me a better shot of Mikuru’s outfit please, I can’t make it out well enough to judge it.  (Kyon has no style sense, Koizumi probably does but not one that meshes with me.)\n- Cut to Haruhi looking straight at the camera as she talks about how this is their only freshman high school vacation.  They knew exactly what they were doing there and I love it.\n- Mikuru’s outfit is the inverse of Haruhi’s and doesn’t work quite as well as you would think… leaving them roughly on par.  Also bored Yuki is bored, but what’s new?\n- The cicadas are crying so loudly!  (Now if I could only make out what kind.  They almost sound like higurashi/evening cicadas despite calling in the middle of the day.)\n- 04:21: PFFT.  Sometimes you just gotta go for the in-your-face fanservice, you know?\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: magenta halterneck bikini for Haruhi, halterneck white and coral bikini or two-piece with frilly skirt for Mikuru (incredibly cute, especially since the coral matches her hair, probably wins her best swimsuit for the loop despite Haruhi’s best efforts, though I don’t actually like the red bow on the front), teal one-piece (competition swimsuit again?) for Yuki, army green mid-length swim trunks with two vertical yellow stripes for Koizumi, navy blue short trunks for Kyon.\n- Haruhi a cute.  Yuki a bored… and also a cute.  Koizumi a smiler.\n- Keep audience interest: show Gainaxing!  Also, we get the mole at 05:30.\n- LOL our very bored Yuki just floating along to the left matching the speed of everyone running in the background at 05:33… wait a minute.  That might not just be for humor, that might have a point.  Yuki is putting no effort in (since she considers herself an observer) but is still moving forward in the loops at the same speed as everyone else.\n- Oh god the ever more bored Yuki face, now with hidden eyes at 05:57.  Must… offer… hug…\n- More deja vu shown on screen, and then we go to black and white this time to show Kyon noticing it.\n- Yet more crows cawing at midday.\n- Oh.  THAT’S new.  *Yuki is no longer sitting at the side seat when the club meets up for the first time in this loop.*  Instead she is seated by Haruhi and Kyon instead has the side seat.  I’ll bet I know what’s up with that; [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION].\n- Yuki blink at 06:57.\n- Also note the occulted exit sign (the man is blocked by the structural element in the foreground) in this scene.\n- Ooh, might want to pay attention to 07:35 where Yuki goes to take a sip of her drink, notices Kyon looking at her, and stops.\n- Well well well.  We get a table change-up, and now we get Yuki leaving to the right, not the left.\n- For the second episode in a row we get an annoyed Yuki look as Kyon catches up.  (… And now that I think about it I can think of a VERY direct comparison in another time loop anime, though it’s in a hallway there [meta spoiler] >!PMMM 1 to be precise!<.)\n- Also yet another visual barrier for separation.\n- Given Japanese cinematographic left-right symbolism 08:24 probably symbolizes “go this way to get to the future”… oh wait no, it’s also counterclockwise so just the loop, never mind.\n- Swap that red shirt at 08:40 for a red vest and Kyon would be wearing a certain Keiichi’s DEEN outfit, heh. Also Haruhi and Mikuru both brought adorable outfits.\n- Bulk ladies’ store called Endless.  OF COURSE THEY DID.\n- Me, a moment later: “But I know KyoAni, we have the Endless, where’s the eight?… oh, how stupid of me, each shelf has eight piles of clothes for sale on it.  Hurr durr.”\n- Oh shit they upped last episode’s yukatas.  I don’t know how to choose they all look great!  (Haruhi is probably actually the weakest which is saying something, would omochikaeri any of them in those in any event.)\n- HNNGH smiling Mikuru with hair up in yukata is adorable HNNNGH.\n- Is… is Koizumi wearing a ninja outfit to the O-bon festival?\n- Alien mask for Yuki this loop.  (Frowning alien mask too, sounds about right.)\n- 10:51: “So anyways I started blasting.”  (Also I’ll bet that’s a reference.  That’s not the Heavyarms pose again, is it?)\n- The sparklers at 10:57 are looping in the shape of infinity symbols, heh.  (Also the most bored look on Yuki’s face yet.)\n- LOL Kyon goes “three days” in English this time!\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- LOL Kyon ogling the Mikuru at 11:43 ~~I’m not one to talk, guess why my eyes wandered over to where I noticed his~~.\n- LOL Mikuru wearing a Robin Hood hat along with a (denim?) skirt, white sleeveless shirt, and black tights (are they still tights when they don’t go all the way down?  I forget) is something I didn’t know I needed until I got it.  Also Haruhi wearing a sportsman’s vest.  (And Kyon is giving some random /a/non what they want… and if you told me someone on KyoAni actually went on the Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy to see reactions there I would not really be that surprised.)\n- Today, Yuki catches a grasshopper!\n- Desaturation in the supermarket backroom.  Also Yuki is bored and Haruhi’s casual outfit looks good (but I think Mikuru has Best Outfits This Episode on lockdown at this point).\n- Kyon’s “you bastard, you bastard” at 14:11 twinges my “this might be a reference to something I am unfamiliar with” sense.\n- Very different visual barrier this time at 14:18, with Kyon in the box separated from the other three. He’s yet to be filled in on the loop?\n- HNNNGH Mikuru protecc time.\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time.”\n- (Also note all four in the same visual box at 14:36.)\n- Cut to Koizumi’s watch to emphasize that the flow of time has become strange, not new, still worth noting.\n- The extremely repetitive OST here (especially in its beat) is another good use of OST to contribute to mood.\n- Shadow cutting across the door at 15:56 to visually emphasize the section of time that has been cut out?\n- Cut to trashcans, one lid ajar, one closed.  That’s unlikely to be a coincidence.  Representing the overwritten memories but one is ajar because some of said memories kind of escape for those closest to Haruhi?  Would fit with the show’s usual visual reinforcement of words.\n- Another Yuki with hidden eyes at 16:14.  Also yet another visual barrier/separation shot.\n- And we keep the pillar in the same relative place for the visual barrier/separation when cutting to show all of them, not unsurprising but a very strong indicator this was intentional since they do it twice in short order.\n- Cut to a melted discarded popsicle and wrapper for it at 16:52.  Ohh that’s for Yuki isn’t it – the ice queen of sorts is melting!  (Water can represent emotions, remember, and the man on the wrapper has a body type that looks rather like the classic Little Green Man – and Yuki was wearing a mask of that kind of alien’s face at the festival.)\n- Pillar plus cuts also give us visual separation between Koizumi and Kyon, not for the first time this scene this arc.\n- PFFT blatant visual answer cut at 17:58.  But also note: Yuki has moved over to Kyon’s side of the visual barrier…\n- This has the best OST use of 2009 so far, and it’s not close.  (The track that fires up after Yuki drops the 15,527th loop reveal also reminds me quite strongly of a Higurashi anime OST track at their respective starts, actually – Onigaen is the Higurashi track in question I think.  Later parts kind of do too, Onigaen is chime-heavy.)\n- Extremely noticeable Dutch angle at 18:33.  Also note that Yuki’s eyes are hidden in shadow yet again in that shot.\n- Shadow usage at 18:56 might actually merit the “downright brilliant” descriptor, especially with how it frames Yuki’s eyes and shadows one of them and how it makes Kyon’s fingers look almost like claws.\n- Sad Mikuru is sad.\n- The Japanese thing about power lines strikes again at 19:32, though to what end I still don’t know.\n- Shimmering-Sky gets her shimmering sky.  Also, huddled Mikuru.",1670726812,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkzkm/

izq11t6,zi7vno,"**(REWATCHER - DUB/SUB)**\n\n**[Spoiler Free]**\n\nOnly Haruhi can get me to wake up early on a day off to watch the same episode 8 times in a row. \n\nEndless 8 is among the things that makes this series so special so I’m happy to experience it every rewatch! \n\n**Calculator**\n\nThis one is so special. All of those shots with the shimmering lights and the slow motion, the rotating shots with them spinning at the park, and the final shot with the clock of course. But what I appreciate the most is the part where Kyon actually uses a calculator to figure out how long they’ve been looping. Oh and speaking of looping, Haruhi looping at the coffee shop is just so nutty. (Also, the two girls that Haruhi introduces to Kyon and Koizumi totally look like younger versions of Ui and Azusa from K-On! right?) \n\n**Matching Set**\n\nThis iteration felt the most basic to me. I thought it was cool that the girls wore a matching set for their Yukatas so I used it as a metaphor for the episode being just an average Endless 8 iteration. The green scene was interesting because it had no music until Nagato’s part began. Also, the montage at the end had some animation this time and Haruhi speaking as well which was cool. \n\n**Stitch Has a Glitch**\n\nThis episode had the most glitches which makes sense considering it’s nearing the end. The fatigue is really setting in for me. How were you able to do this over 15.5k times, Nagato?  \n\n**IT’S OVER.**\n\nIt makes sense that this iteration will be the canon version for them since they’re wearing the same swimsuits that they wore in Remote Island Syndrome. Also, I love that shot of all the Haruhi’s exiting the cafe and I just noticed that brief flashback to when Haruhi was talking to Kyon about her doing her homework in 3 days.

That being said, staying up late working on animation assignments has been much more enjoyable. \n\n**[Anime Spoilers]**\n\n[Haruhi Anime] >!It’s seriously no wonder that Endless 8 played such a big role in developing Nagato’s “bug”. I absolutely love Endless 8 and think it’s one of the most iconic parts of the series and it’s such a nutty experience every time I go through it. But I only have to go through 8 episodes. Nagato had to go through 15,562 iterations! She’s been stuck in this loop for close to 600 years, so of course she developed feelings. Any normal person would have gone insane so quick. I can only imagine the loneliness, sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc. that Nagato must have felt. But even then, we don’t really know what she felt the whole time. But anyway, I’m a giant fan of Endless 8 and the feelings I felt going through these 8 episodes make Disappearance an experience that much stronger. !< \n\n**[Light Novel Spoilers]**\n\n[ (1) Haruhi LN] >!There’s a couple of interesting lines from Nagato’s explanation that are light novel only. Kyon asks Nagato why she hasn’t said anything and of course Yuki says, “My job is to observe.” Then Kyon asks her when they first realized they were looping and Nagato says, “The eight thousand seven hundred sixty-ninth loop. Revelation has become more frequent as of late.” This is really interesting because that means that the first episode really doesn’t have to be the first iteration. It could possibly be an early loop and there are just no signs of déjà vu yet. Also, there are still loops where they don’t realize they’re looping which must totally suck for Nagato knowing that those loops are dead in the water.!< \n\n[ (2) Haruhi LN] >!A few things I’ll also add is there’s a fun moment between the yukatas and the festival where Haruhi does Mikuru and Nagato’s hair at the park in front of the station (same location as the revelation scene). Also, when they go to the batting cages, apparently Haruhi uses the beat up bat that she swiped from the baseball team. In the anime we know that that bat was given to the Kamigahara Pirates! And finally, there’s a bit more content with the homework scene like how Haruhi tells Kyon not to copy her homework word for word and Haruhi helping Mikuru with her essay even though Mikuru is a junior.!<",1670716872,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq11t6/

izqklsq,zi7vno,"**Rewatcher - Sub**\n\nThank goodness Kyon finally got all his homework done. If we are to believe Itsuki here, Yuki had to endure 595+ years of the same two weeks in order for them to figure out that Haruhi wanted ""share"" in the burden of the others doing homework? Maybe not having the final day of vacation an off day for the brigade was the key and anything other than ""Haruhi, spend the day by yourself!"" would've sufficed? Or, if you'll allow me to don my tinfoil cap for a sentence, perhaps someone else had regret of some form regarding unfinished homework on the night of August 31st and they're the one actually responsible for the loops? Irregardless, gotta feel for poor Nagato; hopefully she doesn't run out of memory/storage!\n\nThe only way for this to be at all enjoyable was for there to be novel bits in each episode, and there certainly was that (favorite ""Kyon answering Mikuru's call"" bit would be either EE V's with the fake number out of service voice, or the more angry ""HELLO?!?"" in EE VII). That notwithstanding, still was a bit of a chore to watch all eight.

You treat every summer between grades like it's a huge deal, and you'll never be able to do it again. Also, it helps you to keep in mind the fact that, despite acting like they're a lot older, Kyon and Haruhi are only 15-16 throughout the whole show.\n\n- Koizumi's hesitation almost screams that he's also picked up on the deja vu that Kyon's been feeling.\n\n- Maybe it's just the lighting in the restaurant, but they gave everyone a slightly darker skin tone because they were out in the sun all day. This is the same studio that did K-On, who did the exact same thing for sure, so it wouldn't surprise me if it was here as well.\n\n- >And just like that, Koizumi managed to find a Bon Festival the very next day.\n\n Coincidence?\n\n- Granted, the school year in the US is different than in Japan, but I only had summer homework once, between freshman and sophomore year.

izzeq1w,zi7vno,"> Also, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.\n\nIt's not actually that difficult a calculation to do in your head. There's 52 (and some change) weeks in a year, so since the loop is two weeks, divide the loops by 26 to get the total time in years. Since dividing by 26 is a pain, instead divide by 25, which is much easier.\n\nSince division is distributive, break it into components: `10,000 / 25`, Four 25s is 100, 10k is one-hundred 100s, so 400 loops. Half that again accounts for `5,000 / 25`. Repeat for the smaller numbers. Then correct for the difference between 25 and 26 in the divisor. 1/25th is 4% and it's a large enough divisor that the reciprocal is very close. So move the decimal place over twice and multiply by four, then subtract that from the value you got before, and you get the number in years.\n\n```\n15,532 loops = (10,000 / 25 + 5,000 / 25 + 500 / 25 + 30 / 25 + 2 / 25) - 4%\n== (400 + 200 + 20 + 1.2 + 0.08) - 4%\n== (621.28) - (6.2128 * 4)\n== 621.28 - 24.8512\n== 596.4288\n```\n\nYou can simplify it a bit further by dropping some of the decimals if you want, or increase accuracy by carrying them over. The above example is primarily demonstrative of a way you could do it. I didn't double check how precise Kyon gets, but it's easy to get it all the way to exact if you're willing to start with the correct factor of 365.24 days per year, or `365.24 / 7 = 52.177` weeks per year.\n\nI know from working with foreign researchers that the Japanese education system emphasizes confidence in mental arithmetic skills _much_ more than the US education system does. I can do it in my head, though it might take me a minute or two, and I'll have an easier time if I can talk out loud and/or use paper. I've definitely known people who could do the calculation confidently in their head in a fraction of the time that it would take me, because they've practiced the skill of mental arithmetic.",1670888246,t1_izq8d7x,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izzeq1w/

(This is a signs joke.)\n- Okay, lit streetlamps really have to be a Japanese cinematographic motif in and of themselves that I’m just unfamiliar with.\n- Observation angle (like what you would get from a security camera) for Yuki the self-proclaimed observer observing a human tool of observation (17:07).  Recursion!\n- My, that nervous Koizumi laughter here in the final loop.  ~~It’s a shame there’s not much sign of poly in this cast, The SOS-dan Polycule would resolve quite a lot.~~\n- Frog?  FROG!

The weather is new though, and of course this is the final loop so I’m really not sure that’s right.  (At least here.  There’s one other work where it quite clearly is correct.)  Could be meta and Plato’s Cave imagery again too, I suppose.\n- 18:37: Return of the Kyon sore demo.\n- Mikuru at 19:10: Cute outfit to go with resigned depression.\n- Koizumi still a prep, but 19:12’s shirt is the kind of prep I can work with.\n- Hello photonegatives of all the previous loops also standing up.

That’s a visual wrap-up of a motif for you!\n- And note how we get Haruhi putting exactly one step over the threshold before turning back.  (Have to set both feet in or more accurately out of bounds to complete the catch, just like in the NFL!)\n- Also, time to say it one more time in plaintext to the tune of “get in the fucking robot Shinji” since he is about to actually do it: DO THE FUCKING HOMEWORK, KYON!\n- The ridiculously bombastic music here is the cherry on top of the icing, because it is SO overdramatic relative to the mundaneness of the situation – but as Kyon has pointed out more than once, that’s Haruhi (character and show) in a nutshell!\n- Shocked Yuki is shocked at 21:27!

izr5ny8,zi7vno,"Ok, sorry for snapping at you.  There are a lot of trolls, and ""people"" looking for a fight on Reddit.  \n\nTo answer your question, in the US when I went to school there were 2 systems of grading school work.\n\nThe most common one is assigning letters \n\n* A - Excellent, well above average\n\n* B - Above average\n\n* C - Average\n\n* D - Poor, below average\n\n* F -  Failure\n\nIdeally schools the grades in a class should form a Bell Curve centered on C, in reality the grade distribution is a Bell Curve centered between A & B, with almost no F values.  This is done for political reasons, and results in High School Graduates who are illiterate.  (This is a huge political problem in the US that flares up with both sides pointing at each other).\n\nIn my statement, I was speaking of college.  I went to a real Engineering University and the average GPA was around 2.5.  (GPA is calculated by converting a letter grade into digits A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, and F-0.  I went to college a long time ago.  In most modern Universities the average GPA is well above 3 nowadays, and this is also due to political problems.  (Note:  It does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there are real Engineers who only skated their way through engineering school.  One may note how stupid our politicians and billionaires tend to be.  Most of them have advanced degrees, which really speaks to the value of a higher degree from an American University where no one fails.  The Sheep as well as the Goats all pass equally).\n\n\nThe other set of grading system is Pass/Fail or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.  This system, I've only seen in University and it's self explanatory.  Classes that use this grading are not counted in the GPA.\n\nI hope that answers your questions, and I'm sorry again for doubting your motivations.",1670737697,t1_izr0wt8,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izr5ny8/

If just as many people are getting F's and D's as A's and B's then the teacher has failed. F's are especially almost always a sign of the system having failed the student, and not the student failing the system.\n\nUniversity is somewhat different depending on the major. I also did an engineering degree and witnessed the absolute slaughter that some professors did to prospective engineers.

Racism is a part of it, plus there is a general idea that a poor grade demeans a student and thus demotivates them regardless of race.\n\nMore importantly, issuing a poor grade can result in a law suit which is very expensive & risky for both the teacher and the school district.  Juries have been known to hand out ridiculous awards because a poor grade was given.\n\nSo...  The Teachers with the tactic approval of the school district don't hand out poor grades to avoid the trouble.

izpxxoj,zi76ry,Glad to hear that I was hoping such a tale could at least entertain people.

izpz23w,zi76ry,"Thanks for your opinion: perhaps that is arrogant and that’s another criticism the main character would go through. The point of showcasing stories of other religions is meant to enlighten people of the qualities of a faith. Christianity arose from Judaism and shared many moral lessons (Ten Commandments) with the faith. My only idea was for the main character to explore the world, survive the dangers of a new world and government not tolerant of his faith and help others simply ponder their own moral compass to see if they truly still feel  they are fine as they are or need to change for the better.

izpu298,zi6g4l,"**First Timer**\n\nIn the previous episode, we learned that the biggest Mylene fan is the total creep, who doesn't care about her feelings, and instead is interested in one thing and one thing only. Obviously, I'm talking about Guvava. The guy even made a shitty plushie of him! Can you believe the indecency? Yeah, I too am lost for words. Even the hospital didn't make him learn his lesson.\n\nAnyway, enough about him, let's check out today's episode.\n\n* Capturing a Protodeviln? But you already did that, and it ended up being completely useless. How about instead you go back and try to recover parts of Gigil's or Valgo's bodies, to maybe learn what they are made of and how you can kill them? They might be hard to find in the rubble from the destroyed planet, but not impossible with future tech, I'm sure. [](#hardthink)\n\n* It's true that he warmed up to the military lately, but still, Basara actually going with this plan is so out of character for him. \n\n* Irreversible action? Is Gabil gonna transform into kaiju or something?\n\n* Wait, we're in a battle? [](#kotourashock) That was abrupt. \n\n* Wait, no. This is some kind of simulation. \n\n* Wait, wait, wait. So Rey and Veffidas *can* produce sound blasts? [](#haaaaaaah) This is literally the first time we're seeing this. Why they never did it in battle? It was literally never brought up before. And now they are casually doing it. What the fuck, show?\n\n* So, the issue is that Basara is too strong and cannot be contained? Understandable.\n\n* Gamling stepping from behind the three like a stalker was weird. Not sure why they made the scene like that.\n\n* Basara has become addicted to space. \n\n* Veffidas eyecatch! [](#rengehype)\n\n* I don't understand how this sound cage works from the geometry standpoint. The visual doesn't make much sense, but I guess, it works somehow. [](#nyanpasu)\n\n* Is that the record for how fast Gabil lost his mech?\n\n* What? Fusion? [](#jawdrop)\n\n* Noo, not like this. [](#frustration) Why didn't you two do some kind of fusion pose, you had such a golden opportunity!\n\n* Wait, why are you thinking that Macross Cannon would work on this thing? You saw what it takes to kill a Protodeviln, you basically need an energy amount, capable of ripping apart a planet. I'm pretty sure, a single Macross Cannon is not even close to being that powerful. If you had 10 Macross ships all shooting together, than maybe we could talk about it, but this will just do nothing.\n\n* Yup, like I said, it did nothing. [](#indexsmugshrug)\n\n* Mylene, don't just watch while Basara is getting killed, start singing.\n\n* It's Sivil! [](#SPORTS)\n\n* Well, this should've been a hype moment, but it was severely gimped by sub-par art and directing. \n\n* Wait, they split again? But I though it was irreversible? [](#bigshock)\n\n* So, Sivil used a bunch of Spiritia to shield Basara, and now she's on the run again? Makes sense.\n\n* Abrupt ending, as always. \n\n**Overall thoughts:** I swear to god, this director just cannot direct action scenes. He makes them anti-fun. After this show, he shouldn't be legally allowed to come near action anime ever again, I'm personally willing to file a restraining order against him.\n\nAnd yes, I realize that there are multiple directors working on the show. In my eyes, it just means that they all have failed spectacularly and should retire from action shows and only direct horny fansevice romcoms from now on. How can you take a story like this and make the action so un-fun? You have a fusion, and it doesn't even have animation. A resulting creature also is barely animated. You have a beam battle, but it is drawn in such a way, that it's hard to even see what is happening. A big fun of beam battles is the tug-of-war between two beams, and instead of that, we got [this cut](https://i.imgur.com/ODU8ErD.jpg), which is just horrendous compositionaly, and has like two frames of animation. And then, there was a capture situation, which was just Grabil standing still with some bland special effects around him. And don't even get me started on the Macross Cannon shot. It comes out of nowhere, with zero buildup, no transformation sequence, no nothing. You just immediately know that it's gonna fail. That's not how you should treat Macross Cannon, it deserves more respect.\n \nOutside of the bad action, this episode was alright. I still think that Basara was too easily convinced to go with the plan, but it's not a huge deal. I also thought the fusion would be permanent, and Gabigula will bite the dust, but I guess, not?\n \n**QotD:**\n\n1) Rey definitely knows how to handle him.\n\n2) Nope.",1670713616,t3_zi6g4l,/r/anime/comments/zi6g4l/do_you_remember_love_macross_franchise_40th/izpu298/

Given that we had Valgo die not too long ago, I suppose it really is time to find something that can fill that gap.\n\n- l’m sure you could make some kind of horseshoe theory joke about how the UN Spacy wants to capture a Protodeviln with Anima Spiritia and how the Protodeviln want to capture Basara to study his Anima Spiritia, but I’m kind of drawing a blank. We could probably make a Spider-Man point at himself meme out out of this episode plot, at least.\n\n- Even this far into the series, Basara is still having a hard time working perfectly in synch with Sound Force, this time not even trying to match his singing to Mylene’s during the capture operation practice. I suppose we never really got a full resolution to him being shown not really appreciating teamwork, now that I think about it. It’s just been slightly smoothed over and pushed to the side this whole time. The situations we’ve been seeing just haven’t made the issue that prominent.\n\n- “Square up, Mylene.” —Gamlin, basically.\n\n- And so, the teamwork issue is solved by… Mylene moving in a bit closer. That’s really it. I mean, it doesn’t really solve any underlying issues, but it does synchronize the beams of Sound Energy, so whatever works I suppose. At least it shows that Mylene is brave.\n\n- Surprise! Like a stock shonen villain, Gabil wasn’t even using his full power before now. Behold, his true fused form with Grabil: Gabigula! Gabil is basically now a feathery Gundam head crest on Grabil’s body.\n\n- Of course now that Battle 7 fired its Macross Cannon again, it did absolutely nothing against Gabigula except singe some feathers. Although I guess that’s kind of to be expected from a Protodeviln that can apparently casually blow up moons with their shockwave. That’s really on the same level of power we saw Gigil have in his true form.\n\n- Well, Sivil’s rescue is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it did save everyone from Gabigula, but on the other, she instinctively started to drain Basara of Spiritia before feeding off other other pilots. I suppose it was hard for her to control her instincts, since she looked to regret it before flying off.",1670713239,t3_zi6g4l,/r/anime/comments/zi6g4l/do_you_remember_love_macross_franchise_40th/izpt8qi/

Realized something about this while writing that earlier Basara point, Mylene is commendable here because of here trying to find a way that works, but Basara could've also just flown in closer to better reach Mylene. That way is not compromising his ideals while also helping out his friend. Maybe have both close the distance.\n\n[Favourite character watch.](https://i.imgur.com/FmpwdQM.png) A very hidden Flower Girl, but crowd shots are the perfect place to hide away a Flower Girl cameo.\n\n[](#binoculars)\n\nGabil fuses with Grabil to form literally [G(r)abil](https://i.imgur.com/PgCcZ0a.png) or as they call it, [Gabigula.](https://i.imgur.com/jJZfMuB.png) This better not count as the seventh Protodeviln.

It's not like her to... not be doing anything.\n\nExsedol's out of his bridge spot.\n\nAnd there you have it, folks: seven Protodeviln. That's all there are. Or at least, all that were sealed \nby the Protoculture using Anima Spiritia. Two are dead, and there's one unaccounted for, as well as Geppelnitch's true form.\n\nBasara doesn't like the plan of capturing a Protodeviln. What a freaking shock.\n\n...that was a quick turnaround. What part of that convinced him?\n\nThe thing is, Basara's right: we do know the Protodeviln are not pure evil. Gigil was capable of love for another. \n\nGabil has a dangerous plan? And I'll say Geppelnitch can't afford to lose more minions, if there are only five Protodeviln \nleft at all, counting himself.\n\nFor a second there I thought they were actually against Gravil, not a hologram.\n\nHmm, I think they added a little bit of dissonance in the song here, perhaps just to fit with the story? It sounded like Basara and \nMylene were just slightly off in their timing.\n\nThat's a dangerous tack to take, Gamlin. You know how prideful Mylene can be... yep. Though I expected her to get mad and yell at \nhim, not just run off.\n\nWell, look at that, Basara DOES own a spacesuit!\n\nI know it's a consequence of reused footage, but how does this fleet have any VF-11's left after all the losses we've seen?\n\nLooks like Mylene is actually taking Gamlin's advice and trying to up her own singing.\n\nThat's... actually kind of a clever idea.

If you can't win \nwith raw power, then win with math!\n\nGeppelnitch is in fortune cookie mode now too. \n\nAnd there goes Gabil's ship.
