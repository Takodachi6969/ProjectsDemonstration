Anime,zidj09,1670729990,I asked an AI (ChatGPT) to write a story about bojji the prince who wanted to become the strongest king. Here's what it wrote:,"""Bojji was the youngest prince of a great kingdom, and he was determined to become the strongest king the world had ever known. From a young age, he trained tirelessly in the art of combat, mastering every weapon and fighting style he could lay his hands on.\n\nAs he grew older, Bojji's reputation as a fierce warrior began to spread, and he was soon known throughout the kingdom as a fearsome opponent. He was not content to rest on his laurels, however, and continued to push himself to ever greater heights of skill and strength.\n\nOne day, a powerful sorcerer approached Bojji with an offer. The sorcerer had a magical potion that would grant Bojji immense strength and agility, but at a terrible cost. The sorcerer warned Bojji that the potion would consume his soul, turning him into a monstrous, unstoppable force of destruction.\n\nBojji was tempted by the offer, but he knew that true strength came from within. He refused the sorcerer's offer, and instead continued to hone his skills through hard work and dedication.\n\nFinally, the day came when Bojji's father, the king, passed away. Bojji was ready to take his place as the strongest king the kingdom had ever known. He proved his worth in battle after battle, vanquishing all who challenged him and earning the respect and admiration of his people.\n\nBojji ruled justly and wisely, and his kingdom flourished under his leadership. He never forgot the lesson he had learned from the sorcerer, and he never allowed his thirst for power to consume him.\n\nAnd so, Bojji the prince became Bojji the king, the strongest and most honorable ruler the kingdom had ever known.""",https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zidj09/i_asked_an_ai_chatgpt_to_write_a_story_about/

Another tale of Oda's fetish for absent fathers and Luffy somehow knowing everyone.\n\nIt's decently plotted, I mean they do a good job of hinting and explaining stuff, they hint at what's going on early and the action scenes are cool. You might not be able to ignore the obvious CGI, things start out cheesy and then turn dark quick (which I liked).

Anime,zi76ry,1670715052,Anime Idea: Teaching Christianity in another world.,"Main character is a kind young Christian training to be a priest when he is murdered by a robber. Before he dies he says ‚Äúlord please forgive him and myself for our sins‚Äù rather than curse the murderer. God and Jesus greet him in heaven and decide to reward his kind spirit with a chance to save a world in a parallel universe that has debilitating morals. They order him to teach about god and Christianity to the people of that world and turn them over a new leaf as they worship polytheism, commit atrocities like murder rape and slavery on a regular basis and must be enlightened. The main character accepts and tries to pass on stories of Christ but has trouble do to many people not caring or not believing him as his own admission Jesus never lived on the new planet, but he is determined to see his mission through despite the dangers of the evil governments placing a bounty on him for trying to convert people. \n\nStories he tells include: Jesus birth, King Herad ordering the deaths of young boys to try and kill Jesus, Jesus death and resurrection, the prodigal son story.\n\nWhat you think? Please type in the chat your ideas for this or if you don‚Äôt think it is good enough just please be civil.

I highly appreciate an original story and a detailed animation, I‚Äôm aware of other old school animes but my limit is the animation style, I can watch easily Mononoke, Pro Mare, Sonny Boy, Monogatari, Ping Pong but although they are hugely suggested I can‚Äôt stand the awful character design in Code Geass, Clannad, Angel Beast). Neon Genesis Evangelion was a lucid dream, fantastic.\n\nHxH is still one of my favourite if we‚Äôre talking adventure, lore, world building and action, same with One Piece, Bleach, Baku no hero, and  Naruto (I‚Äôm reading  can‚Äôt stand to see the anime and its fillers, in fact I‚Äôm seeing most of One Piece following One Pace stellar editing. Tensei Slime and Mushoku Tensei are my favourite of the reincarnated genre, I don‚Äôt like Overloard for the character design.\n\nComedy wise I‚Äôve watched countless times Great Teacher Onizuka (plus every possible manga from the author), Mob Psycho, Love is War, One Punch Man, I lost it watching Nichijou and its clever pun game and references (I know Gintama would be the obvious choice but it doesn‚Äôt particularly attract me), Honda san (skeleton librarian anime), The way of the husband. I really enjoy the comedy plus action of Full Metal Panic and Spy x Family.\n\nJujutsu Kaisen is the max in terms of creepiness, I don‚Äôt like Psycho pass and really hated Death Parade and Chainsaw man, can‚Äôt stand the excessive gore, violence and excessive psychological absurdity. I‚Äôm well comfortable and enjoy greatly Stein‚Äôs Gate.\n\nI love the style of studio Bones, Madhouse and Ghibli.\n\nI am an avid manga reader (at the moment everything Urosawa and Akira.\n\nAsk me anything to have a better idea, sorry for my poor English, thanks everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/

Or should i say the action heavy climactic episodes take up more precedence over the introspective experimental dialogue episodes where it's just characters talking.. think about something similar to Monogatari or Monster. \n\nNow it seems the more shinier and fluid animation there is the more better as a whole the actual series or movie is.
