Anime,izq8d7x,zi7vno,"First timer, subbed\n\n  \nSo we've finished the infamous arc that supposedly ruined the show's reputation. I gotta say, it was definitely a bold move on the directors to do something like this, and I respect them for trying something new. Now, if I were keeping up this while it aired weekly, I'm sure I would be feeling a certain type of way. But the privileges of the internet allow me to binge it and analyze all the small differences from episode to episode, which I probably wouldn't have picked up on a week-to-week basis.   \nOne thing I find very cool about it is that they don't reuse any scenes, every shot is framed differently, even if it's the same events. If I were into filmmaking or cinematography, this would be a great resource for learning about those types of things. I like that they manage to stay creative in how they present things, such as the last scene in the 5th episode where the camera rotates with the ticking clock, which was pretty damn cool to me.  \nThe atmosphere is also different from episode to episode. Some episodes are lighter in tone, and some are downright unnerving at times.   \nI can't say I watched every second of every episode, because I value my time slightly more than that, but I did skim through using arrow keys to make sure I caught all the little details. I also wanted to make sure I heard all the music, too, because they used a bunch of new ones that I don't think I've heard before. The OST is pretty stellar, and I don't want to miss any.   \nSpeaking of music, I can only count a handful of times when I've skipped the OP or ED, but this is one of those times. Not because either of them are bad, in fact I quite like the emphasis between the music and the visuals, but I just don't think I can handle more monotony (even if the scenes aren't completely identical). I'll probably go back to listening to them afterwards, though.  \nAlso, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.  \nThere are a whole bunch of other miniscule differences I could write down, but they're not worth mentioning, and everyone has probably already noticed them, anyways.  \nNow did the ending make all of this worth it? ... I'm not sure about that. I feel like more could have been done or built up over the eight episodes to create a more satisfying conclusion. What we got wasn't bad, and implies something more to Haruhi and Kyon's relationship I guess, but I felt like it could have been more ... climactic? It just didn't feel like it was worth eight episodes of monotony. Maybe if it were two or three. All in all though, it was a pretty interesting idea, and I don't regret the experience, but there's no way in hell I'll ever do this again.\n\nQOTD: Procrastination hasn't bitten me in the ass (yet) but it has given me a decent amount of stress the night before.",1670720431,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq8d7x/

Its peak hatred was as it was airing in 2009, likely in part due to how KyoAni chose to air Season 2 (which you can learn more about [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/7k3oec/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya_day_16/drbb8hm/)). It even got the Season 1 director, who had no part in the creation of season 2, to [issue an apology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqy8x-zKuKw) due to the backlash it got.  Endless Eight was not originally meant to be shown in this fashion though. From a roundtable meeting in 2010, Fumihiko Shimo, scriptwriter for both the TV show and *Disappearance*, discussed how *Disappearance* was originally an 7 episode arc meant to be a part of S2. \n\n> **Shimo:** That's already a tale from long ago. (laughs) In June of 2007 was when we first started. At\nthat time we had plans to make Disappearance part of a TV season.\n\nInstead, the script ballooned so much in size that it was instead decided that *disappearance* should be split into its own movie instead to give it a proper adaption, and even then it was cut down from what script supervisor Tatsuya Ishihara wanted.\n\n> **Ishihara:** And while we’re speaking of wants, I actually wanted it to be a bit longer. There were more scenes I wanted to include in this work. We made Melancholy six episodes but we still had to cut down the original work considerably.\n\nThe roundtable doesnt go into any discussion as to why EE was chosen though. The easiest guess is that future content relied on Disappearance happening before they could be animated (and while i havent read the LN's fully yet, i know this is true for at least [Haruhi LN story title]>!Snowy Mountain!<). I dont have much more to speculate on why this was chosen though.",1670716969,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq196w/

Maybe more information may give a clue about why are they looping?\n\nSpeaking of that talk, does it take place in the same park where Nagato called Kyon and where he and Mikuru time traveled, or is it another place?\n\nThere were so many details even though the plot is the same in each one, Trying to spot the differences was fun!. Had a good laugh when they placed the no diving sign just in front of the pool where there is no way Haruhi couldn't see it and she did it anyway!\n\nI was torn thinking between the reason for the loop being because Haruhi wanted to be noticed more by Kyon that summer specially since Koizumi hinted at it, or the homework just because every episode ended with him not doing it. Amazing how Kyon just had almost 6 centuries procastinating homework!\n\nWhy do you think Nagato is gone from the club?",1670721879,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqb815/
Anime,izq1rag,zi7vno,"**Stuck In A Time Loop (don't tell Haruhi)** \n\nSo! I have a confession to make. I've never really cared about watching anime just as it comes out, especially not when I had to sail the high seas to watch anything at all, so by the time I watched season two of Haruhi Endless Eight was already a known thing. \n\nSo I skipped most of it. \n\nThis is the first time I have watched all eight episodes, and honestly? Having done it once, I don't think I'll ever do it again. Which is a damn shame, because Endless Eight could - and should! - have been absolutely *amazing*. \n\nI knew the story going in. I've watched Haruhi before, and I've read the original story this arc is based on. But at the end of the third episode, I was still hit by a wave of genuine *dread* over the situation the characters were in. It *worked*. \n\nAnd then episode four ended. And episode five. And on, and on, and *on*. And that feeling of dread morphed into 'why isn't this over yet?' \n\nIn my personal opinion - and I know plenty of people in this rewatch disagree, more power to you if you enjoyed the full arc - KyoAni's **only** mis-step with Endless Eight was making it last a full eight episodes. If they'd ended it after four, or maybe five at a stretch, I think it would be seen as some of the best storytelling in the series instead of being the thing that nearly killed it. \n\nStill! It's not only doom and gloom. The artists quite gleefully supplied a variety of different outfits for all the main characters, and I've always appreciated it when anime studios take the time and effort to expand characters' wardrobes. They really didn't spare any effort for Endless Eight, and made sure all of the episodes were unique instead of just copy-pasting. Different camera angles, changing where the characters were or went during the different events, focussing on separate aspects each time...KyoAni put a *lot* of work into this arc. \n\nI just wish it didn't outstay its welcome.",1670717210,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq1rag/

Anime,izqh87b,zi7vno,"**First timer (subbed)**\n\n**EPISODE 5:** New swimsuits! Koizumi rocking the speedo like a slut. Haruhi is now playing water dodgeball instead of water soccer. \n\nWith every loop, I'm more and more frustrated by the fact that Nagato does absolutely nothing to inform the rest of the brigade that they're stuck in a time loop. Yeah, yeah, she's ""only there to observe"" or whatever, but COME ON. Please tell me she breaks it.\n\nA lost child announcement at the Bon festival? That's new. Is it gonna be plot relevant? \n\nBut they didn't show the girls buying their yukata? Boo! I'll give this one to Haruhi (The score is Haruhi 3-2 Nagato). And Asahina has always worn a pink one, which is weird cause Haruhi picks them out and she's had some cool designs.\n\nHAMSTER FISHING?!\n\nNew Nagato mask! Again, it's Ultraman related.\n\nThe shit-spewing firework is back from EE1!\n\nHaruhi is now 5-0 in cicada catching competitions.\n\nNew store they're selling balloons in front of! Give me those other jobs already! I wanna see how Nagato performs in a call center job.\n\nKyon tries to pull the ""The number you are calling is not in service"" fake message bit for the middle of the night call.\n\nKoizumi flexing his watch like a rapper when he's talking about the time loop is kinda funny, and why did a couple of guys show up and presumably try to hit on Asahina?\n\nLoop counter is now at 15,521 from 15,513 last episode. Number of festival-less loops, goldfish-less loops, and number of jobs has not changed. I would like to know how many loops have had hamster fishing.\n\nRain! And some new activities: seeing the brigade at a train stop, and Haruhi spinning them around in some contraption that I forgot the name of.\n\nKyon scribbles an ""8"" on the paper, which is a hint as to how many episodes this will go on.\n\nWHY IS IT LOOPING HARUHI SAYING GOODBYE TO THE REST OF THE BRIGADE?\n\nThe camera rotating with the seconds hand of the clock was a cool effect.\n\n**EPISODE 6:** Tank top Kyon!\n\nKoizumi brought an inner tube to the park before they went to the pool. Did he know where they were going?\n\nNew swimsuits! Love Haruhi's heart pattern. We're back to water soccer, and once again we see Haruhi killing Asahina via kicking a ball and hitting her in the face.\n\nNew yukata! Asahina isn't wearing pink! And this gets her the win in my book (Haruhi 3, Nagato 2, Asahina 1).\n\nKyon rocking the sigma shirt to the Bon festival cause he's a sigma male.\n\nNew Nagato mask! Next time she reads off the stats, I want to know how many times she bought a non-Ultraman mask.\n\nKoziumi came prepared with fireworks, too! He MUST know the routine by now.\n\nShit-spewing firework counter: 3\n\nKoizumi's the one to show off the not-cicada he caught, and Haruhi is now 6-0 in cicada catching competitions.\n\nNew supermarket to hand out balloons in front of!\n\nI am SO tempted to skip past the scenes I already know, but I know that I'll be missing something, so I won't.\n\nLoop counter is now 15,524, up from 15,521. Festival-less and goldfish-less loops have stayed the same, but bitch-ass Kyon interrupted Nagato before we learned what jobs they did.\n\nKyon's mental math ability to calculate 15,524*14/365 in his head is amazing.\n\n**EPISODE 7:** We can't see the baseball game!\n\nNew swimsuits! And a screen full of Haruhi ass for the fans. We also looped Kyon calling the public pool a communal pool, for some reason.\n\nWhy is your hand in the back of your pants while you're sleeping, Kyon? 🤔\n\nNew yukata! Once again, no pink for Asahina. I'll give this one to Haruhi (Haruhi 4, Nagato 2, Asahina 1).\n\nIs Koizumi wearing...a gi? No wait, that's a jinbei. \n\nNew Nagato mask! It's an alien.\n\nShit-spewing firework counter: 4\n\nHaruhi wins the cicada catching competition using only her hands, improving her record to 7-0. And Asahina wore a Robin Hood hat.\n\nNew supermarket they have to hand out balloons in front of! We're not gonna see any other jobs, are we?\n\nOnce again, Kyon is sticking his fingers in his ass at night.\n\nAsahina just speaks gibberish when she's trying to tell Kyon she can't time travel.\n\nTime loop counter: 15,527. Number of festival-less loops, goldfish-less loops, and number of jobs: unchanged. \n\nKyon glitches out when he tries to stop Haruhi.\n\n**EPISODE 8:** Let's close this fucking loop!\n\nAnts carrying off cicada wings? Does this mean she'll lose a cicada catching competition?\n\nKyon says he went to the park just for Asahina.\n\nAre these the swimsuits from the rich dude's island? And Kyon's speaking in old-timey words for some reason when pointing out the ""No diving"" sign.\n\n8 episodes, 8 Bon festivals, 8 goldfish scooping booths. Haruhi wins the last round of yukatas, putting the final scoreline at Haruhi 5, Nagato 2, Asahina 1.\n\nFinal Nagato mask! They're all Ultraman related.\n\nShit-spewing firework counter (final): 5\n\nCicada catching competition: Haruhi wins! 8-0 in cicada catching competitions! Interestingly, one cicada was chilling on Kyon's net after the competition was over.\n\nFinal job: it's the same fucking job. My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.\n\nFinal loop counter: 15,532. 2 non-festival loops, 437 non-goldfish loops, 9,056 loops with a job, 6 unique jobs (of which we only learn of 5 and see 1)\n\nAnother rainy day!\n\nFUCKING FINALLY! HE INTERRUPTS HARUHI LEAVING ON THE 30TH! The secret to breaking this fucking loop: having a big last-second homework completion session!\n\nNagato doesn't show up to the club because being forced to run the same two weeks over 15,000 times in a row means you deserve a break every once in a while. We end with Kyon getting a royal flush in his poker hand.\n\nIT'S FUCKING FINISHED! It was actually more fun than I thought it would be, but still got annoying at the end.

Anime,izqlbab,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n**DAWN OF THE FINAL DAY.  ONE EPISODE REMAINS.**\n\n- More cicadas!\n- Oh THAT’S a fun little overhead panning shot at 00:05: it uses a concave lens in order to show the warping of time, making everything look kind of like something closed in on itself.\n- OST use good again this episode.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Color palette and the plant out of focus in the foreground at 00:45 gives a washed-out feeling to the shot, similar to E8-2.\n- The baserunner’s expression at 01:13 is probably going to be foreshadowing for Kyon at the end of this final loop.\n- Ants carrying away the wings of a dead cicada at 01:21.  That’s unlikely to be just a scene; we are reaching the end of the cicadas, and likewise the endless summer.  Especially when it’s overlaid over Kyon’s line about how summer is already over.\n- Right, there are exactly eight characters in Endless Eight’s name.  Should have noticed it earlier, this episode makes it easy.  Sasuga Nagaru Tanigawa!  (Also I think they may be back to normal writing, another hint that this is the final loop.)\n- Haruhi has best outfit here at the first meetup today, Mikuru’s doesn’t quite flatter her.  (Koizumi keeps getting disqualified for looking too prep, Kyon doesn’t give a rat’s ass.)\n- Dutch angle for the “summer should be like summer, so we have to do summer activities” line? That’s a new one for this loop.  Also it focuses the camera on Haruhi’s crotch (might be more than just fanservice, ulterior motives for spending time with Kyon go!), but we get a little something for everyone – Kyon’s position and the way his clothes bag emphasize his ass as well.\n- Quick cuts for deja vu, I do believe.\n- Pan down to beach ball… cut to Haruhi’s beachballs.  Heh.\n- Also, FINAL LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: orange side-tie bikini (pretty sure it counts and isn’t just a two piece) for Haruhi, frilly pink polka-dotted one piece with skirt for Mikuru (shouldn’t work on her but does, but I think Haruhi probably has the better suit this loop), green one-piece with a light green vertical stripe down the front for Yuki (she may have worn this one before actually), blue long swim trunks with a white stripe down each side for Koizumi, teal long swim trunks with a cyan-ish vertical stripe down from where the pockets are/would go for Kyon.  (It’s the important things in life.)\n- Okay, props to Sugita Tomozaku for his delivery of the “restrain yourself!  Can’t you read the No Diving sign?” at around 04:00.  (It’s deeper than his usual Kyon voice and I think that’s intentional for humor; it works.)\n- What’s that, screentime of two boys with well-defined physiques that focuses on their chests?  See, the fanservice is equal-opportunity today!\n- Well well well well.  There’s a sneaky little shot: Yuki floating down the pool on the front of the screen towards the left but looking right around 04:43, with the camera focusing more on Haruhi and Mikuru in the background so you might not notice.  Yuki is moving into the future but still focusing on the past, then?\n- 04:47: sore demo alert!\n- Bored Yuki continues to be very bored.\n- 05:42: Note Yuki sitting in the shade while both Koizumi and Kyon sit in the sunlight.  Welcome to the melancholy of Yuki Nagato.  (Also this plus Japanese reading the screen right to left might be setup for [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION]; I’m actually quite reminded of something in the visuals for Colorful from Rebellion.)\n- Oooh, 05:55.  We get sepia for Kyon looking at Yuki (sepia being the tone of flashbacks, visual indicator of deja vu), but also notice Kyon being framed in light here as he notices – he’s seen the metaphorical light by noticing Yuki.\n- Haruhi following this up by moving so that her shadow covers Kyon thus blocking him from the light is also interesting.  (Was the animator for this scene a Kyon/Yuki shipper?  Could just be Haruhi and her force of personality blocking out Kyon thinking about the deja vu.)\n- Fish-eye lens at 06:32.  (Also Mikuru’s outfit does work better on her in this light.)\n- And oh would you look at that, Kyon is still in the offset seat to the side that he was in last episode but that Yuki was in in all episodes before that.  Funny that.  More on that… later.  ([CLASSIFIED INFORMATION])\n- (Note to self: Broadcast order post-2009 would probably actually work better if you switched the positions of Sighs and E8.)\n- Haruhi’s outfit ALSO works better on her in this light.  Gorgeous isn’t quite the right word; “you look extremely attractive in this, Haruhi” is about right.\n- Sad bored Yuki just looking at her drink at 07:30.  (Hug.  Hug.  Hug.)\n- Just showing the hand gesture for Haruhi waving everyone free?  I don’t actually know what to make of that.\n- In this final loop Yuki leaves in the same direction as everyone else, off towards the left… oh, that’ll be final loop foreshadowing again, they all get to go off into the future after this.\n- Ooh, Yuki blink as she (white lies and) tells Kyon she’s all right.  Note how we didn’t get many Yuki blinks in the early episodes but we are getting them late?  Funny that.\n- Extremely low-angle shot of Kyon and his shadow at 08:12 as he wonders why he called out to her. The shadow faces right; just the long shadow of past loops then?\n- It’s between Yuki and Haruhi for best yukata today and it’s close (though not like Mikuru’s is bad, but while part of me thinks it goes great the other part thinks the shade of yellow – or possibly white colored by the lighting – is just a little wrong for her), but shout to Kyon, that olive vest he’s wearing actually works for him IMO even if it’s a little too loose.\n- This loop’s Yuki mask: an alien one to end the cycle.  This could not be a metaphor, no never.  It’s not like the entire point of this is that the artificial human Yuki is increasingly a real human just wearing an alien mask, no never.  (Also remember that alien as representing the autism spectrum is a take with a long vintage.)\n- OST cutoff as Kyon resolves to ask Haruhi about her homework.  (Quiet point I should have remembered/thought of earlier: Kyon asking about this is probably his him hinting that he’d like to do homework with everyone.  I know you get this same kind of subtle hinting when it comes to Japanese dating.)\n- Also yes, funny that they make sure to keep the homework lines in every episode, yes?\n- Fanservice for everyone; now we get a subtle Yuki butt focus shot at 10:30.\n- See also: Haruhi positioned in the montage shot at 10:39 so that her own butt and her legs are centered in the screen.  And Mikuru falling right after that in a way that emphasizes *her* ass.\n- Yuki rhinoceros beetle catch GET!\n- Also LOL at Haruhi catching Mikuru while going for another cicade at 10:42.\n- Well well well, would you look at that.  One cicada actually came back this time, even landing on the net.  Why, they did return the favor!  Another indicator this is the FINAL ~~LAP~~ LOOP.\n- Another day, another good Haruhi casual outfit this loop at 11:45.\n- Huh.  Different framing at 12:19, with us seeing Kyon straight from the side looking towards the wall but to our eyes looking towards the window.  Actually reminds me of Shaft style somehow.  Also he’s looking into the past, I suppose.\n- Props to the subbers for trying to get across Mikuru’s blubbering here!\n- PROTECC THE MIKURU AND THE YUKI.\n- Yuuko Gotou outdid herself this time around I see (and, more importantly, hear).\n- Well well well well.  What have we here, two moths fluttering around a lit streetlamp.  This is A Thing in Japanese cinematography, though I forget exactly what it means.  (I’m used to associating it with impending death, but that’s not the case here.  Impending doom maybe, where the doom is the loop?)\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time!”\n- The choice of framing Koizumi by his folded arms and legs at 13:46 is notable.  I don’t think that’s fanservice, but I’m not sure what the point is.  (He’s hiding some of his thoughts?)\n- Note all four of them in a group framed facing left/towards the future at 14:23, unlike past loops.\n- Nice shot of the shadows on the floor at 14:35 as Koizumi talks about Haruhi having lingering regrets/something she wants to do, a metaphorical shadow over the proceedings.  But in fact there is a deeper layer here, since the real issue is another metaphorical shadow over the proceedings: the impending doom of homework looming over Kyon.\n- Butterfly or moth at 14:44, more time loop symbolism I do believe.  (But now fluttering to the left into the future, hmm?)\n- Note the trash can with its lid ajar off to the side at 14:53… and unlike the other version of this scene where we got this, this time the open can is the one to the left.\n- Also note how quickly this version of this scene is progressing relative to previous ones.  I wonder why?\n- Welllll then.   Note 15:10… where Koizumi gestures *towards the screen* while talking about how one person remembers everything.  He’s talking about Yuki… but he is gesturing towards you the viewer, who also remember everything of the last eight episodes.  (This entire adaptation choice is about putting you in Yuki’s shoes.)\n- “Who is that?”  The person whose eyes are out of frame (not just hidden) when you ask that at 15:12, Kyon.  I like visual answers!  And visual answer cuts too, and we get one of those right after with the cut to Yuki’s face.\n- Ooof, Yuki’s expression and hidden eyes at 15:31.\n- REACTION SHOT!  Wide eyes and then the can dropping to the ground!  (And the can starts spinning in a loop, heh.  But note: it spins *clockwise*.)\n- And then a blatant Dutch angle immediately after this for more emphasis.\n- LOTS of Dutch angles, now with fish-eye lens as well at 15:57.\n- Can on the ground remains blunt loop symbolism… oh, but it’s also Yuki’s silent cry for help (second episode of this arc with this motif), heh.  “I have no mouth and I must scream.”",1670726980,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqlbab/

(u/ZapsZzz will appreciate this.) Is when Koizumi and Kyon are talking about romancing Haruhi to try to break the loop, Mikaru and Haruhi are asleep (Its very cute how they sleep together too.) But Nagato is awake and hearing the whole thing, if we accept she also has a crush on Kyon how do you think this conversation makes there feel especially with them saying it as if it doesn't matter that she is there?\n\nNotice on the Last Loop they have the OG swimsuits from the Mystery Island Arc.\n\nKyon finally figures it out and you have to love his overblown melodramatic reaction from his revelation, and how from Haruhi's perspective (since she doesn't know about the loop) He's lost his damn mind. Also how despite the fact she is finished with her homework she wants to come to.\n\nIt really does show she is spoiled but has a kind side, she wanted to set aside a day and didn't want summer to end until she was sure Kyon was done with his homework. (And perhaps the others as well.)\n\nI've been told by LN stans in the comments that in the Novels Haruhi does do more to help then play video games while they are all studying.\n\nIt also shows that she does have a limited perspective and why she is a bit of a spoiler and naive bratt, She is super smart and doesn't have to try, athletic, has a forceful personality, lots of energy, is an S tier beauty, can be quite charming when she wants, she has the whole world in the palm of her hand, is good at everything she tries, and very few things challenge her, and yet while others would see her as living the dream and best life you can live, due to her existential dread it all doesn't mean anything to her. (Or at least it doesn't until she meets Kyon and the S.O.S Brigade.) It's very hard for her to understand and empathize with others due to her outlook and talent, and in turn its hard for others to connect with her.\n\nKyon might be annoyed with her, and see her as a bit of a nuisance, but he also (even within the club) is the only one that actually....well *sees* **Her.** And not see her as a God, Beast, or Natural Disaster, Just a Human Being (Albeit an annoying bitch of one.) And despite seeing how much of a pain she is and understanding what she is capable of. (Both mundane and supernatural.) He gives her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nQOTD: I'm like Haruhi I never procrastinate and get things done as soon as possible to get it out of the way.",1670733728,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqy8rx/

I would've liked it if we got some sort of build-up for it though. The solution was pretty obvious from the get-go and then it all wrapped up in a matter of minutes at the end. I know it's not what they were going for, but in any other show Kyon, Koizumi, and Mikuru would probably start trying to get out of the situation after their initial middle of the night meet-up. Instead they just gave up and moped around with Koizumi thinking of a single solution and not pushing it, Mikuru not trying at all, and Kyon only ever trying at the very last moment (fitting for the whole procrastination thing I guess). Nagato gets a pass because her orders are just to observe, but since she is willing to answer questions I'm surprised no one bothered asking her questions each time. Like, surely most people would think to ask things aloing the lines of:\n\nHey Nagato, what have we previously tried?\n\nThis one question each time would have caught them up to speed and progressed the situation, so it's frustrating to see all three of them do nothing.\n\nAlso, given the no-diving signs, I wonder if the two times they ended up not going to the festival were because Haruhi injured herself diving.\n\n**QOTD**\n\nI procrastinated in high school a lot, but I still always gave myself enough time to finish the work, and in college there wasn't really room for procrastinating, cause there was always a lot of work to do, most of which I couldn't give a good time estimate on before starting.",1670780229,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izt45a4/

Anime,izrgvw5,zi7vno,"FIRST-TIMER sub/dub\n\nI am disappointed by the solution. At least, I would have liked to see them together on 31st. \n\nAnyways, there were lot of cool things to see in these episodes- the different outfits, the slight differences and changes every time, progressions(how kyon stops using calculator), the clock scene was pretty cool. The little sister's unnecessary 'kyon, your phone is ringing' was funny to me. Enjoyable. \n\nQOTD: loss of learning and good studying habits, overall  unsatisfying academic experience and that stupid last moment stress, and absolutely useless last-minute cramming that makes everyone think you are way smarter than you actually are.

Anime,izscj56,zi7vno,"First-timer:\n\nI must be a masochist, because I watched all eight episodes. \n\nI am torn. I understand the concept. It's like we're suffering the same way Nagato did, and I liked all the subtle differences in each episode. Doing it once on a weekly basis probably was better, because there'd be build up and then you're right back where you started, instead of marathoning all 8 episodes in the span of 2 days. \n\nBut man, it was starting to get painful after episode 4. I don't think I'll rewatch all 8 episodes again, or at a minimum do all 8 in 2 days. I think they could have gotten away with cutting that in half. \n\nAs for the ending, I figured it had to do with homework based on the quote and emphasizing it at the end of each episode. Haruhi assumed everyone had their homework done, because she doesn't really understand that people think differently than her (besides maybe Kyon), and in her mind summer can't be enjoyed unless it's done. She probably picked up on Kyon not enjoying things fully because he had not finished his homework, and figured he wasn't truly enjoying summer like she had, and wanted him to feel satisfied with no regrets about summer. \n\nAnd that's what it keeps going back to. She comes off very egomaniacal, but she clearly cares about Kyon a lot, and his obliviousness (or maybe refusal?) to indulge triggers these ridiculous situations. \n\nQuestion:\n\nNot sure if this counts as homework, but I put off doing a grad school application until the last minute, and then because I overslept the deadline to get the transcript from my college, I missed being able to put in the application for my top choice.",1670768350,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izscj56/
Anime,izqjz82,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- Clouds again, also a tilted unlit lantern (going left, heh) to emphasize that something is wrong.\n- Discarded cicada nymph shell, probably yet more references to a certain other work.\n- 00:22 is deliberate and has to be for effect.  The interesting thing is the camera on the phone pointing at you the viewer when Haruhi represents the show and Kyon represents audience and author – the show looking to see what Tanigawa will do and what your reactions to it will be?\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- This is not as well directed and my hand is complaining about last episode’s writeup so imma slack a bit.  Still, 00:27 sticks out too – off angle emphasizing the offness of the situation, probably.\n- 00:46 with the phone would probably have more of a point if I could read moonrunes.  Though really part of that is the name and the other part is probably just length of call so.  Note the subtle zoom, and the cut to a cloud screensaver (clouds again!) right afterwards.\n- Yet more cloud emphasis with the pan to the clouds outside as Kyon talks about how summer’s already over (once again).\n- More nifty tricks with the Endless Eight title card.\n- Shot of Kyon looking at his feet to shot disorientation again (I think) at 03:04.\n- (Bored Yuki is still bored but the counter is suspended for the sake of my hand.)\n- Welp, 03:29.  Haruhi knows what she’s doing.  Also, since Kyon is the audience her resting her breasts on his head probably has a meta point – Haruhi the show is kind of doing the same thing to the audience.  (Reinforced by the pan to her face looking right at the screen as she starts talking to Kyon.)\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: Striped red two-piece for Haruhi, frilly cyan/light blue one-piece for Mikuru, stock school swimsuit for Yuki (old flap style one I think?), long olive trunks for Kyon… OH SHIT IT’S THE SPEEDO EPISODE (but only for Koizumi, thought it was both).  That’ll win him Best Swimsuit today I think, especially with the other swimsuits all being meh except maybe Mikuru’s (it does not look bad on her at all).\n- (I just had the mental image of a Haruhi/Bikki teamup.  THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED.)\n- Quick pan today to represent Koizumi’s deja vu at the world-altering events line.\n- Extremely obvious butterfly shot at 04:40, that’ll be the repurposing of the Butterfly of Death and Rebirth for time loops again.  (Also they’re even more obvious about how bored Yuki is this episode.)\n- LOL Mikuru belly flop.  (Also the frills are specifically just a skirt.)\n- Kyon noticed the bored Yuki!  (Also there’s some Dutch angles around, but that counter is in abeyance as well.)\n- 05:30 is another “this probably has more meanings if you can read moonrunes” shot.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~5:05 P.M. I think?)\n- Concave lens for the eatery scene introduction this time.\n- Mikuru’s casual outfits have been on point this episode so far.\n- Note the lack of a visible exit sign so far this time; we all know at this point we’re here for the long haul.\n- Never mind, there it is at 06:29.  But it’s small and out of focus in the distance, so same effect.\n- HNNNGH that look on Yuki’s face at 07:03.  (A key part here is that Kyon is the only person who checks in on her and she recognizes that, even if I think she’s also somewhat irritated that he keeps doing this without realizing it.)\n- 07:09 is blatant: visual separation via Kyon walking away, he actually came over to check in on her world but is now walking back away from it.  (And it’s where we get the crows cawing, too.)\n- The festival clearly being held in a baseball stadium this time around draws a direct comparison line to the baseball game on TV at the start of the loop.\n- Sepia filter for Kyon stating that he gets the feeling he owes her, heh.\n- Oh, that’s because it’s shot through the eye of the mask for this loop (another robot/tokusatsu one), giving us a really meat transition at 08:12.\n- Yeah, they’re probably supposed to be fireworks particles, but something about the effect at ~08:43 is making me go “dango, dango, dango, dango, dango daikazoku…”  (specifically by comparison to a shot at the end of that ED).\n- LOL Yuki looking right at Mr. Hasn’t Done His Homework.\n- Hello reflection shot at 09:41.\n- That confirms it’s a statue at the park.  (Fountain centerpiece I think.)  Also even more gathering thunderclouds (the incident is brewing again).\n- Strange beetle.  (Not a rhinoceros this time I think, though I think it might actually be the same kind\nas loops 2 and 4.)  Also Yuki knows it’s not a cicada by now so is probably showing off for Kyon, no?\n- Or maybe not the same, this time Kyon namedrops the Yanbaru scarab.\n- Datto shitemo alert!  (Sucks to be Sky.)\n- Panning shot at 10:19 flashes.  Because panorama maybe?\n- It IS the Eva reference episode!  (Also Mikuru getting her head out of the frog costume a cute.)\n- Best Haruhi casual outfit of the episode so far here.\n- I have missed making a “Hauu~!  Haruhi wants to take the frog costume home with her!!!!” joke for five episodes now, let’s fix that.\n- WATCH WATCH.\n- Extremely huggable Yuki at 11:35.\n- Kyon responding to the phone with “the number you have dialed is not [currently in service]” before cutting himself off because Mikuru this time around is a nice touch.\n- A second use this episode of the phone receiving screen for effect.  Must be a point to that.\n- Huh, a shot of delinquents at 12:15 that’s new to this episode.  Not sure what’s up with that, could just be setting the scene though.\n- We get an unnaturally saturated color palette to show the strangeness of the situation this time around.\n- CLOCK CLOCK.  (~1:52 A.M.)  Now with another time loop butterfly, that makes three uses so far this episode.\n- Yuki sitting hunched on the ground in near-fetal position along with Mikuru is another subtle show of her deteriorating mental state.\n- WATCH WATCH.  (Same time I think, also the design represents the loops because of course.)\n- MUST… HUG… AND… COMFORT… YUKI…\n- Props to Yuuko Gotou for her rendition of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line here, that was well-acted.\n- Oh shit Mikuru is wearing dolphin shorts, isn’t she?  I approve!\n- 15:23 flashes; again, Japanese film culture has a thing about power lines.\n- At a meta level, note the “all deja vu is the result of remembering similar events in past lives” reincarnation take.  (Actual Western occultism (not sure about Eastern) doesn’t tend to agree with this, amusingly enough, despite belief in reincarnation also being common there; instead the common theory there goes off the astral plane concept and posits that time does not flow linearly at that level so events in the future can be remembered in the past… which actually also isn’t that far from our time loop here, come to think of it...)\n- Okay Mikuru is also looking extremely huggable at 15:59.\n- Hey, Kyon realized who Koizumi was talking about without needing to be told!  (As reinforced by centering Yuki in the middle of the screen here, focusing your attention on her a second before he speaks up.)  And look at Yuki moving her eyes to look at Kyon as he asks about this.\n- Yuki blink!\n- Holy shit that piano track that fires up after 15,521 works well here.  Sad, emotional, almost tragic, it fits the mood they’re going for perfectly.\n- Shit, I almost missed Mikuru being shocked as well.\n- More blinks.  Keep an eye on that, it might be a visual representation of Yuki slowly getting more human.\n- Hey look, he has a calculator to do the math this time!  (I can actually get close through mental math via shortcuts – 15,498 the original end loop being close to 15,600 which is 600 x 26 (26 two-week periods in a year) exact helps and I did mental math competitions in school back in the day – but not precisely.)\n- And we have FINALLY ticked up to 595 years.\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- HNNGH 18:28 HUG THE YUKI.\n- Also a blunt visual separation shot right after at 18:33.\n- 18:47 because Yuki thinks of herself as an observer (much like that telescope, which might be why she keeps looking through it earlier in addition to looking where it points here) and also a slightly panoramic shot which might be intended to give the impression of an IMAX planetarium.\n- Huh, airplane.  (Also Yuki remains infinitely huggable and infinitely in need of hugs or some other kind of emotional support.)\n- Huh, we get the observer line during the test of courage this time instead of during baseball.  I actually like that choice, this is in many ways Yuki’s emotional test (far beyond what she ever should have had to handle).\n- The thundercloud at 19:55 is more developed than earlier in the episode, which will indicate the gathering metaphorical storm as we approach August 31.\n- Another stadium shot at 20:10, again calling back to the game at the beginning.\n- Another episode with a sore de and then a sore demo (20:21), wouldn’t be surprised if that’s actually in the original LN.\n- The rotating playground thing whose name I forget at 20:29 is another blunt visual metaphor; note the rotation is counterclockwise and Haruhi is pushing it, which is extremely obvious and almost certainly has nothing to do with Great Mandala movements at all in this case.  (Haruhi is after all literally turning the clock back!)\n- And I typed that BEFORE they started rotating the world around the nearly stationary playground equipment towards the end of that shot.\n- Kyon drawing that infinity-looking eight at 20:42 is the bluntest thing in the world.  “You have realized we’re doing this for the full eight episodes by this point, right?”\n- Okay, Koizumi has best swimsuit this episode but Mikuru wins best casual outfit in a walk, she has like three really good ones this episode including this last one here at 20:51.",1670726295,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqjz82/
Anime,izqkjbu,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- This episode seems to like quick cuts for effect – the cicada flash at 00:04, the yield sign (unless Japan didn’t borrow the upside-down-triangle-means-yield convention) at 00:07, the stream at 00:09. (Also I heard crows cawing in the background briefly.)  Another means of representing disorientation, and the first two at least have symbolism relevant to time loops.\n- Kyon only wearing an undershirt here at the start might be a reference [meta spoiler] >!Higurashi is a possibility, though Keiichi’s vest in DEEN form is different!<.\n- Good shadow usage at 00:30.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Facial animation looks better than usual this episode.\n- Okay, that’s the best opening title card yet.  Infinity symbol Endless Eight is on point.\n- Also, Haruhi your fashion sense is off today.  (Koizumi looks average, so Mikuru will take this in a walk.)\n- LOL Kyon holding the inflatable whats-it-called over his shoulder as he goes “well I suppose that makes sense with these preparations”.  More “no shit” than usual, that’s a straight-up visual gag I think.\n- Kyon is a target today!\n- I really should probably note how each half of each episode after the first is structured so that the first half has Kyon receiving a phone call and then going to this park, just with the time of day inverted.\n- Oh wait, Koizumi has the inflatable instead of Kyon.  (Also Yuki is bored, but count still suspended.)\n- Haruhi’s head in the foreground blocking Mikuru’s face in the background at 03:46 is also an interesting shot choice.  I’d say another “no, don’t look at her, look at me!” but Haruhi’s not really visible either.\n- 04:02: Mikuru is cute!  (Yuki is still bored.)\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: Haruhi: halter-top baby blue bikini with red, yellow, and white hearts on it (props for the design, massive minus points for the colors clashing with her); Mikuru: pastel rainbow bikini/two-piece with a front tie on the top and a skirt on the bottom; Yuki: competition swimsuit; Kyon: long red trunks; Koizumi: medium blue trunks with a white design on them.  I think Mikuru wins this one still, but Yuki actually comes quite close, that competition swimsuit works on her.\n- The quick cuts are in fact this episode’s way of showing disorientation/deja vu.\n- Also LAMP LAMP in the background at the pool, not sure it was visible in any prior episode.\n- Yuki is at least swimming!  Good for her.  (Except… there might actually be more to it.  Water can symbolize emotions… and we’ve seen Yuki getting into the water more and more over the course of these episodes, joining the always emotional Haruhi and Mikuru.  Funny that.)\n- Cute Yuki at 05:20.  (The thing about this episode’s Yuki is that she doesn’t look quite as bored as she has in the last three and she probably should be.)\n- Never mind, there we go, bored look back at 05:23.\n- Wait, Mikuru’s swimsuit is another halter-top!  That’ll win her Best Swimsuit today from me.\n- Fanservice ho!\n- Muting out the music as Kyon looks at Yuki’s boredom is a good audio touch.\n- I’ll go ahead and note that Dutch angle at 06:02, the episode is using it as the “something is wrong” visual cue here.\n- Poor Mikuru.\n- And now we see Mikuru with a heating or cold pad on her face in the restaurant at 06:30; nice touch!\n- Yuki’s never been out of the side chair IIRC for reasons I explained yesterday, but 06:41 draws attention to it well.\n- Exit sign never shows up here either, they know you know it’s not ending this episode.\n- Return of the power lines!\n- Yuki moving left again at 07:28; not the first time we’ve seen her moving to the left (future) as Kyon catches up to check on her.\n- Ooh, THAT’S noteworthy.  Note the tree in front of Yuki at 07:31 when she stops to turn towards Kyon; Kyon is blocking her path to the future.  (Do the fucking homework, Kyon!  Also might have more to say, but I think I’d rather not talk about that until I can admit a point from Disappearance which might be relevant.)  Also note her facial expression; it looks almost irritated as she closes her eyes right before she turns to face him.\n- 07:35 is a visual box shot with slightly different symbolism; Kyon has entered the box (the little trapped loop world) Yuki is in to check up on her.\n- And then the cut at 07:48 means that Yuki’s head *becomes* the tree, interesting.  Might have an idea there, but again I want that Disappearance point in evidence for that.\n- 07:54: HNNNGH MUST HUG THE YUKI.  (She almost looks concerned to me there… and then right back to looking irritated from the side as we cut back to the box frame.  Also cue the crows.)\n- Haruhi was saving her fashion sense for the yukata I see; the color coordination (same main color, different secondary colors) works perfectly, yukata winner today is all three as a unit because they are more than the sum of their parts.\n- Kyon wearing a sigma T-shirt.  Probably supposed to be a math joke knowing this show (infinite sum), but there’s a meme joke to be made here that couldn’t have been intended since said meme postdates this series by at least half a decade, probably twice that.  (Or I could make an ancient Greece joke, IIRC Spartans were reputed for using shields with a sigma printed on them.)\n- Oh right there’s the other Eva reference, there are subtle Unit-02 and Unit-00 references in the colors of two of the mask types today.\n- Was half-expecting Yuki to go for the Unit-00 mask because obvious Rei expy is obvious, but no it’s another robot mask.  (Same symbolism as it’s had for several episodes now, Yuki’s robotic demeanor is a mask by now.)\n- … ooookkkaaay, so Mikuru really can rock a ponytail if she wants to.  [](#towel)\n- And in turn an extremely cute Haruhi att 11:14 (that facial expression plus that yukata just works). Also I think she’s bouncing her breasts a bit to appeal to Kyon.\n- PFFFFT Koizumi is wearing a safari park ranger getup for the cicada hunt.  (Meanwhile Mikuru is wearing a farmer’s overalls/shirt/hat.  You know, she could probably try the proverbial sack too, she’d probably rock it just fine.)\n- Dutch angles for the cicada-catching competition montage.  Something is amiss!  (Again.)\n- Ah, more higurashi cries.\n- Huh, fan in the supermarket office is CGI.  Obvious enough this time (12:28).\n- Okay, what mecha is Adzam Leader from?\n- Well, Haruhi’s tank top at 12:35 works on her, at least.\n- Huh.  Mikuru uses “atashi”.  Never noticed that before.  Might be a hint that at least some of her moeblobness is an act, actually.\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time!”\n- The visual separation this time around is really strange, with Koizumi separated consistently from both Kyon and Mikuru.  Possibly because the espers have done the research and neither of them really have?\n- Something about the VA performance and/or animation for Mikuru during this version of the [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION] line.  She doesn’t quite manage to land being distraught enough (which is the idea, she’s blabbing without heed and getting filtered by a verbal censor).\n- “When the loop starts over, we won’t remember ever having this conversation.”\n- Koizumi and Yuki in the same visual box at 17:02 because they’re the two with better info on the situation, Yuki separated from the other three because she remembers, got it.\n- 18:27: Good shadow usage, also PROTECC THE YUKI.\n- Another Dutch angle for disorientation.\n- Rotating shot at ~19:10 is the flashiest of the episode so far (counterclockwise because literally against the clock).\n- Oof that zoom-out on Yuki at 19:36.\n- You know, this show knows about Sisyphus.  Kyon walking his bike up the road at ~19:53 might be symbolism of the same kind: moving the bike up the hill to try to get past the crest (August 31), but implicitly he does not manage it.\n- Ooh, twinkling stars!\n- This loop Yuki brings a book to the roof, I see.\n- Mikuru still not swinging at baseballs I see… wait I take that back, she actually does try!  She’s improving!  (Just a little.)  (But does she want to improve at this specifically?  That is the question.)\n- LOL we get Haruhi sleeping on Yuki for a change.\n- Exit sign visible this time at the final restaurant meeting.\n- Does Haruhi manage to snipe best outfits this episode after all?  She’s come on strong late (and Mikuru’s outfits have stagnated).\n\n---\n\n> What's the biggest problem procrastinating on your homework has given you\n\nThere's a couple of classes in college where I just ate a lost point of GPA rather than do the homework.",1670726581,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkjbu/
Anime,izqkzkm,zi7vno,"###Kyon-kun, Denwa (Rewatcher for 2006 [Watched in Broadcast Order], First-Timer for 2009 and Disappearance, Source Reader):\n\n- Uh-oh, direction is back in shape, I might have to put in more effort.  Also, nice August 8 start there, and nice use of the tape dispenser to represent the loop at 00:08.  Also the Rule of Three repetition of “strange” (“okashi”) before starting up the usual opening line (“something was strange”).  It’s like a film projector or a record player skipping… which is probably another part of the tape dispenser shot, too.\n- The OST for this scene works very well to set the mood, too.\n- Oh right, the stuttering is also just visual/audio representation of deja vu.  Duh.\n- “Kyon-kun, denwa.”\n- Also nice use of shadows with the light from the TV screen shining over the unnaturally dark room (also mirrors E8-2 in a way, but not in others).  It’s like the TV screen is the only source of light on the situation – which might be meta, the events on screen are the only light at the end of the tunnel that was the E8 fan experience.\n- There might be deeper meaning to the couch shot around 01:25… separation since Imouto doesn’t remember anything and is just blindly watching events new to her while Kyon has faint past memories? Hmm, with the TV here might be a meta angle – oh right, we the viewer are via the POV further removed from the TV (the surface image of the world) than either Imouto or Kyon, since we remember everything.  (And then there’s Yuki watching the TV from a lightyear behind us…)\n- Aww the title is just a small ring this time.\n- You wouldn’t think Haruhi’s outfit here would work on her, but it does.  (A bit hot though I would think.)  Also give me a better shot of Mikuru’s outfit please, I can’t make it out well enough to judge it.  (Kyon has no style sense, Koizumi probably does but not one that meshes with me.)\n- Cut to Haruhi looking straight at the camera as she talks about how this is their only freshman high school vacation.  They knew exactly what they were doing there and I love it.\n- Mikuru’s outfit is the inverse of Haruhi’s and doesn’t work quite as well as you would think… leaving them roughly on par.  Also bored Yuki is bored, but what’s new?\n- The cicadas are crying so loudly!  (Now if I could only make out what kind.  They almost sound like higurashi/evening cicadas despite calling in the middle of the day.)\n- 04:21: PFFT.  Sometimes you just gotta go for the in-your-face fanservice, you know?\n- THIS LOOP’S SWIMWEAR: magenta halterneck bikini for Haruhi, halterneck white and coral bikini or two-piece with frilly skirt for Mikuru (incredibly cute, especially since the coral matches her hair, probably wins her best swimsuit for the loop despite Haruhi’s best efforts, though I don’t actually like the red bow on the front), teal one-piece (competition swimsuit again?) for Yuki, army green mid-length swim trunks with two vertical yellow stripes for Koizumi, navy blue short trunks for Kyon.\n- Haruhi a cute.  Yuki a bored… and also a cute.  Koizumi a smiler.\n- Keep audience interest: show Gainaxing!  Also, we get the mole at 05:30.\n- LOL our very bored Yuki just floating along to the left matching the speed of everyone running in the background at 05:33… wait a minute.  That might not just be for humor, that might have a point.  Yuki is putting no effort in (since she considers herself an observer) but is still moving forward in the loops at the same speed as everyone else.\n- Oh god the ever more bored Yuki face, now with hidden eyes at 05:57.  Must… offer… hug…\n- More deja vu shown on screen, and then we go to black and white this time to show Kyon noticing it.\n- Yet more crows cawing at midday.\n- Oh.  THAT’S new.  *Yuki is no longer sitting at the side seat when the club meets up for the first time in this loop.*  Instead she is seated by Haruhi and Kyon instead has the side seat.  I’ll bet I know what’s up with that; [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION].\n- Yuki blink at 06:57.\n- Also note the occulted exit sign (the man is blocked by the structural element in the foreground) in this scene.\n- Ooh, might want to pay attention to 07:35 where Yuki goes to take a sip of her drink, notices Kyon looking at her, and stops.\n- Well well well.  We get a table change-up, and now we get Yuki leaving to the right, not the left.\n- For the second episode in a row we get an annoyed Yuki look as Kyon catches up.  (… And now that I think about it I can think of a VERY direct comparison in another time loop anime, though it’s in a hallway there [meta spoiler] >!PMMM 1 to be precise!<.)\n- Also yet another visual barrier for separation.\n- Given Japanese cinematographic left-right symbolism 08:24 probably symbolizes “go this way to get to the future”… oh wait no, it’s also counterclockwise so just the loop, never mind.\n- Swap that red shirt at 08:40 for a red vest and Kyon would be wearing a certain Keiichi’s DEEN outfit, heh. Also Haruhi and Mikuru both brought adorable outfits.\n- Bulk ladies’ store called Endless.  OF COURSE THEY DID.\n- Me, a moment later: “But I know KyoAni, we have the Endless, where’s the eight?… oh, how stupid of me, each shelf has eight piles of clothes for sale on it.  Hurr durr.”\n- Oh shit they upped last episode’s yukatas.  I don’t know how to choose they all look great!  (Haruhi is probably actually the weakest which is saying something, would omochikaeri any of them in those in any event.)\n- HNNGH smiling Mikuru with hair up in yukata is adorable HNNNGH.\n- Is… is Koizumi wearing a ninja outfit to the O-bon festival?\n- Alien mask for Yuki this loop.  (Frowning alien mask too, sounds about right.)\n- 10:51: “So anyways I started blasting.”  (Also I’ll bet that’s a reference.  That’s not the Heavyarms pose again, is it?)\n- The sparklers at 10:57 are looping in the shape of infinity symbols, heh.  (Also the most bored look on Yuki’s face yet.)\n- LOL Kyon goes “three days” in English this time!\n- Milky Way Milky Way!\n- LOL Kyon ogling the Mikuru at 11:43 ~~I’m not one to talk, guess why my eyes wandered over to where I noticed his~~.\n- LOL Mikuru wearing a Robin Hood hat along with a (denim?) skirt, white sleeveless shirt, and black tights (are they still tights when they don’t go all the way down?  I forget) is something I didn’t know I needed until I got it.  Also Haruhi wearing a sportsman’s vest.  (And Kyon is giving some random /a/non what they want… and if you told me someone on KyoAni actually went on the Wretched Hive of Scum and Villainy to see reactions there I would not really be that surprised.)\n- Today, Yuki catches a grasshopper!\n- Desaturation in the supermarket backroom.  Also Yuki is bored and Haruhi’s casual outfit looks good (but I think Mikuru has Best Outfits This Episode on lockdown at this point).\n- Kyon’s “you bastard, you bastard” at 14:11 twinges my “this might be a reference to something I am unfamiliar with” sense.\n- Very different visual barrier this time at 14:18, with Kyon in the box separated from the other three. He’s yet to be filled in on the loop?\n- HNNNGH Mikuru protecc time.\n- “We’ve entered an endless recursion of time.”\n- (Also note all four in the same visual box at 14:36.)\n- Cut to Koizumi’s watch to emphasize that the flow of time has become strange, not new, still worth noting.\n- The extremely repetitive OST here (especially in its beat) is another good use of OST to contribute to mood.\n- Shadow cutting across the door at 15:56 to visually emphasize the section of time that has been cut out?\n- Cut to trashcans, one lid ajar, one closed.  That’s unlikely to be a coincidence.  Representing the overwritten memories but one is ajar because some of said memories kind of escape for those closest to Haruhi?  Would fit with the show’s usual visual reinforcement of words.\n- Another Yuki with hidden eyes at 16:14.  Also yet another visual barrier/separation shot.\n- And we keep the pillar in the same relative place for the visual barrier/separation when cutting to show all of them, not unsurprising but a very strong indicator this was intentional since they do it twice in short order.\n- Cut to a melted discarded popsicle and wrapper for it at 16:52.  Ohh that’s for Yuki isn’t it – the ice queen of sorts is melting!  (Water can represent emotions, remember, and the man on the wrapper has a body type that looks rather like the classic Little Green Man – and Yuki was wearing a mask of that kind of alien’s face at the festival.)\n- Pillar plus cuts also give us visual separation between Koizumi and Kyon, not for the first time this scene this arc.\n- PFFT blatant visual answer cut at 17:58.  But also note: Yuki has moved over to Kyon’s side of the visual barrier…\n- This has the best OST use of 2009 so far, and it’s not close.  (The track that fires up after Yuki drops the 15,527th loop reveal also reminds me quite strongly of a Higurashi anime OST track at their respective starts, actually – Onigaen is the Higurashi track in question I think.  Later parts kind of do too, Onigaen is chime-heavy.)\n- Extremely noticeable Dutch angle at 18:33.  Also note that Yuki’s eyes are hidden in shadow yet again in that shot.\n- Shadow usage at 18:56 might actually merit the “downright brilliant” descriptor, especially with how it frames Yuki’s eyes and shadows one of them and how it makes Kyon’s fingers look almost like claws.\n- Sad Mikuru is sad.\n- The Japanese thing about power lines strikes again at 19:32, though to what end I still don’t know.\n- Shimmering-Sky gets her shimmering sky.  Also, huddled Mikuru.",1670726812,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqkzkm/

Anime,izq11t6,zi7vno,"**(REWATCHER - DUB/SUB)**\n\n**[Spoiler Free]**\n\nOnly Haruhi can get me to wake up early on a day off to watch the same episode 8 times in a row. \n\nEndless 8 is among the things that makes this series so special so I’m happy to experience it every rewatch! \n\n**Calculator**\n\nThis one is so special. All of those shots with the shimmering lights and the slow motion, the rotating shots with them spinning at the park, and the final shot with the clock of course. But what I appreciate the most is the part where Kyon actually uses a calculator to figure out how long they’ve been looping. Oh and speaking of looping, Haruhi looping at the coffee shop is just so nutty. (Also, the two girls that Haruhi introduces to Kyon and Koizumi totally look like younger versions of Ui and Azusa from K-On! right?) \n\n**Matching Set**\n\nThis iteration felt the most basic to me. I thought it was cool that the girls wore a matching set for their Yukatas so I used it as a metaphor for the episode being just an average Endless 8 iteration. The green scene was interesting because it had no music until Nagato’s part began. Also, the montage at the end had some animation this time and Haruhi speaking as well which was cool. \n\n**Stitch Has a Glitch**\n\nThis episode had the most glitches which makes sense considering it’s nearing the end. The fatigue is really setting in for me. How were you able to do this over 15.5k times, Nagato?  \n\n**IT’S OVER.**\n\nIt makes sense that this iteration will be the canon version for them since they’re wearing the same swimsuits that they wore in Remote Island Syndrome. Also, I love that shot of all the Haruhi’s exiting the cafe and I just noticed that brief flashback to when Haruhi was talking to Kyon about her doing her homework in 3 days. I love her masking her excitement by scolding Kyon and Haruhi blushing is always welcome as well.\n\n**Nagato Yukata Ranking**\n\n1. Gintoki\n2. Lavender, Purple Lines, Orange Obi\n3.

That being said, staying up late working on animation assignments has been much more enjoyable. \n\n**[Anime Spoilers]**\n\n[Haruhi Anime] >!It’s seriously no wonder that Endless 8 played such a big role in developing Nagato’s “bug”. I absolutely love Endless 8 and think it’s one of the most iconic parts of the series and it’s such a nutty experience every time I go through it. But I only have to go through 8 episodes. Nagato had to go through 15,562 iterations! She’s been stuck in this loop for close to 600 years, so of course she developed feelings. Any normal person would have gone insane so quick. I can only imagine the loneliness, sadness, anger, hopelessness, etc. that Nagato must have felt. But even then, we don’t really know what she felt the whole time. But anyway, I’m a giant fan of Endless 8 and the feelings I felt going through these 8 episodes make Disappearance an experience that much stronger. !< \n\n**[Light Novel Spoilers]**\n\n[ (1) Haruhi LN] >!There’s a couple of interesting lines from Nagato’s explanation that are light novel only. Kyon asks Nagato why she hasn’t said anything and of course Yuki says, “My job is to observe.” Then Kyon asks her when they first realized they were looping and Nagato says, “The eight thousand seven hundred sixty-ninth loop. Revelation has become more frequent as of late.” This is really interesting because that means that the first episode really doesn’t have to be the first iteration. It could possibly be an early loop and there are just no signs of déjà vu yet. Also, there are still loops where they don’t realize they’re looping which must totally suck for Nagato knowing that those loops are dead in the water.!< \n\n[ (2) Haruhi LN] >!A few things I’ll also add is there’s a fun moment between the yukatas and the festival where Haruhi does Mikuru and Nagato’s hair at the park in front of the station (same location as the revelation scene). Also, when they go to the batting cages, apparently Haruhi uses the beat up bat that she swiped from the baseball team. In the anime we know that that bat was given to the Kamigahara Pirates! And finally, there’s a bit more content with the homework scene like how Haruhi tells Kyon not to copy her homework word for word and Haruhi helping Mikuru with her essay even though Mikuru is a junior.!<",1670716872,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izq11t6/

Anime,izqklsq,zi7vno,"**Rewatcher - Sub**\n\nThank goodness Kyon finally got all his homework done. If we are to believe Itsuki here, Yuki had to endure 595+ years of the same two weeks in order for them to figure out that Haruhi wanted ""share"" in the burden of the others doing homework? Maybe not having the final day of vacation an off day for the brigade was the key and anything other than ""Haruhi, spend the day by yourself!"" would've sufficed? Or, if you'll allow me to don my tinfoil cap for a sentence, perhaps someone else had regret of some form regarding unfinished homework on the night of August 31st and they're the one actually responsible for the loops? Irregardless, gotta feel for poor Nagato; hopefully she doesn't run out of memory/storage!\n\nThe only way for this to be at all enjoyable was for there to be novel bits in each episode, and there certainly was that (favorite ""Kyon answering Mikuru's call"" bit would be either EE V's with the fake number out of service voice, or the more angry ""HELLO?!?"" in EE VII). That notwithstanding, still was a bit of a chore to watch all eight. Oh well, we've made it through the gauntlet; onwards to new stories!\n\n**QOTD**\n\nHave pulled a few all-nighters due to procrastination.

Anime,izqvjku,zi7vno,"**Rewatcher - Dubbed**\n\nSorry everyone, but I cheated. I'm only going to watch the last episode of the Endless Eight, since I can't bring myself to sit through it all.

That's impressive!\n\n- The only downside to watching the dub instead of the sub is misssing out on the ""Kyon-kun, den wa!"" scene in all of its glory.\n\n- >We have to do what we can, while we can, during our one and only summer as 10th graders!\n\n I remember when I was her age. You treat every summer between grades like it's a huge deal, and you'll never be able to do it again. Also, it helps you to keep in mind the fact that, despite acting like they're a lot older, Kyon and Haruhi are only 15-16 throughout the whole show.\n\n- Koizumi's hesitation almost screams that he's also picked up on the deja vu that Kyon's been feeling.\n\n- Maybe it's just the lighting in the restaurant, but they gave everyone a slightly darker skin tone because they were out in the sun all day. This is the same studio that did K-On, who did the exact same thing for sure, so it wouldn't surprise me if it was here as well.\n\n- >And just like that, Koizumi managed to find a Bon Festival the very next day.\n\n Coincidence?\n\n- Granted, the school year in the US is different than in Japan, but I only had summer homework once, between freshman and sophomore year. My teacher made us read a book and write a paper on it, and I remember **hating it**. The book wasn't interesting to e at all. I probably bombed it.\n\n- They did a good job of seamlessly weaving the CLASSIFIED INFORMATIONs into her regular conversation.\n\n- >Then, how many times has this happened to us?\n\n >This would be 15, 532 times so far.\n\n And that's the line that reallly makes you feel for Nagato. She's had to go through pretty much the same stuff every single day over 15,000 times. She lived through 595 years of it.\n\n [**Poor Nagato**](#sadholo)\n\n- I think that Kyon's comments about needing to do *something*, otherwise his summer would never end, is evidence that supports the ""Kyon is actually the God"" theory. He was just using Haruhi as a scapegoat for putting his summer homework off, and only felt like he needed to do something different because he saw Nagato suffering as a result of it.\n\nQuestion of the Day:\n\n>What's the biggest problem procrastinating on your homework has given you?\n\nProbably the numerous nights where I had to stay up late to finish it, when I should've been in bed.\n\n[Haruhi Spoilers]>!Isn't the effects of the Endless Eight part of the reason Nagato causes The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya to happen?!<",1670732280,t3_zi7vno,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izqvjku/

Anime,izzeq1w,zi7vno,"> Also, how in the world did Kyon calculate weeks to years in his head? At least in episode 5, he used a calculator, but other than that I'm not sure he's the normal human being he thinks he is.\n\nIt's not actually that difficult a calculation to do in your head. There's 52 (and some change) weeks in a year, so since the loop is two weeks, divide the loops by 26 to get the total time in years. Since dividing by 26 is a pain, instead divide by 25, which is much easier.\n\nSince division is distributive, break it into components: `10,000 / 25`, Four 25s is 100, 10k is one-hundred 100s, so 400 loops. Half that again accounts for `5,000 / 25`. Repeat for the smaller numbers. Then correct for the difference between 25 and 26 in the divisor. 1/25th is 4% and it's a large enough divisor that the reciprocal is very close. So move the decimal place over twice and multiply by four, then subtract that from the value you got before, and you get the number in years.\n\n```\n15,532 loops = (10,000 / 25 + 5,000 / 25 + 500 / 25 + 30 / 25 + 2 / 25) - 4%\n== (400 + 200 + 20 + 1.2 + 0.08) - 4%\n== (621.28) - (6.2128 * 4)\n== 621.28 - 24.8512\n== 596.4288\n```\n\nYou can simplify it a bit further by dropping some of the decimals if you want, or increase accuracy by carrying them over. The above example is primarily demonstrative of a way you could do it. I didn't double check how precise Kyon gets, but it's easy to get it all the way to exact if you're willing to start with the correct factor of 365.24 days per year, or `365.24 / 7 = 52.177` weeks per year.\n\nI know from working with foreign researchers that the Japanese education system emphasizes confidence in mental arithmetic skills _much_ more than the US education system does. I can do it in my head, though it might take me a minute or two, and I'll have an easier time if I can talk out loud and/or use paper. I've definitely known people who could do the calculation confidently in their head in a fraction of the time that it would take me, because they've practiced the skill of mental arithmetic.",1670888246,t1_izq8d7x,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izzeq1w/

Anime,izqlc7v,zi7vno,"###Tar's Episode Notes, Continued:\n\n- The ant trapped in the spilled soda trying to swim out is more visual metaphor for Yuki’s condition, and a callback to her in the pool earlier this episode I think.  (But the ant is swimming right, not left. Not sure why, unless it involves [CLASSIFIED INFORMATION].)\n- Oh hey, Kyon threw the can (and thus the loop) into the trash… as he will throw the loop into the dust-, er, wastebin of history by asking for help with his homework in a bit.\n- 16:49: Are we sure this episode isn’t set in Hong Kong?  (This is a signs joke.)\n- Okay, lit streetlamps really have to be a Japanese cinematographic motif in and of themselves that I’m just unfamiliar with.\n- Observation angle (like what you would get from a security camera) for Yuki the self-proclaimed observer observing a human tool of observation (17:07).  Recursion!\n- My, that nervous Koizumi laughter here in the final loop.  ~~It’s a shame there’s not much sign of poly in this cast, The SOS-dan Polycule would resolve quite a lot.~~\n- Frog?  FROG!  (Not sure why unless it’s a callback to the costume, but.)\n- Reflection shot of the group at 18:26… reflecting the unreality of events due to the loop?  The weather is new though, and of course this is the final loop so I’m really not sure that’s right.  (At least here.  There’s one other work where it quite clearly is correct.)  Could be meta and Plato’s Cave imagery again too, I suppose.\n- 18:37: Return of the Kyon sore demo.\n- Mikuru at 19:10: Cute outfit to go with resigned depression.\n- Koizumi still a prep, but 19:12’s shirt is the kind of prep I can work with.\n- Hello photonegatives of all the previous loops also standing up.  (Also gaudy camerawork for emphasis; some things you can only really do in animation, and this scene is one of them.)\n- And for Kyon’s realization we get… a visual of him looking at a thundercloud, like the ones we’ve been getting the entire arc.  That’s a visual wrap-up of a motif for you!\n- And note how we get Haruhi putting exactly one step over the threshold before turning back.  (Have to set both feet in or more accurately out of bounds to complete the catch, just like in the NFL!)\n- Also, time to say it one more time in plaintext to the tune of “get in the fucking robot Shinji” since he is about to actually do it: DO THE FUCKING HOMEWORK, KYON!\n- The ridiculously bombastic music here is the cherry on top of the icing, because it is SO overdramatic relative to the mundaneness of the situation – but as Kyon has pointed out more than once, that’s Haruhi (character and show) in a nutshell!\n- Shocked Yuki is shocked at 21:27!

Anime,izr5ny8,zi7vno,"Ok, sorry for snapping at you.  There are a lot of trolls, and ""people"" looking for a fight on Reddit.  \n\nTo answer your question, in the US when I went to school there were 2 systems of grading school work.\n\nThe most common one is assigning letters \n\n* A - Excellent, well above average\n\n* B - Above average\n\n* C - Average\n\n* D - Poor, below average\n\n* F -  Failure\n\nIdeally schools the grades in a class should form a Bell Curve centered on C, in reality the grade distribution is a Bell Curve centered between A & B, with almost no F values.  This is done for political reasons, and results in High School Graduates who are illiterate.  (This is a huge political problem in the US that flares up with both sides pointing at each other).\n\nIn my statement, I was speaking of college.  I went to a real Engineering University and the average GPA was around 2.5.  (GPA is calculated by converting a letter grade into digits A-4, B-3, C-2, D-1, and F-0.  I went to college a long time ago.  In most modern Universities the average GPA is well above 3 nowadays, and this is also due to political problems.  (Note:  It does not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling to think that there are real Engineers who only skated their way through engineering school.  One may note how stupid our politicians and billionaires tend to be.  Most of them have advanced degrees, which really speaks to the value of a higher degree from an American University where no one fails.  The Sheep as well as the Goats all pass equally).\n\n\nThe other set of grading system is Pass/Fail or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory.  This system, I've only seen in University and it's self explanatory.  Classes that use this grading are not counted in the GPA.\n\nI hope that answers your questions, and I'm sorry again for doubting your motivations.",1670737697,t1_izr0wt8,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izr5ny8/

Anime,izt6oa8,zi7vno,">Ideally schools the grades in a class should form a Bell Curve centered on C\n\nThough I agree it's dumb how low many school high school standards are, ideally teachers would be good enough and have enough support to be able to get all of their students to genuinely learn the material and pass. If just as many people are getting F's and D's as A's and B's then the teacher has failed. F's are especially almost always a sign of the system having failed the student, and not the student failing the system.\n\nUniversity is somewhat different depending on the major. I also did an engineering degree and witnessed the absolute slaughter that some professors did to prospective engineers. On the one hand, a lot of those professors should never have been teachers, but on the other, it's a good way to filter out people who don't want to put in the work of teaching themselves advanced concepts (a skill more important than anything technical I learned).",1670781227,t1_izr5ny8,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izt6oa8/
Anime,izrjljx,zi7vno,">  good, or political reasons (is it because of happy education? \n\nThere are a number of reasons. Racism is a part of it, plus there is a general idea that a poor grade demeans a student and thus demotivates them regardless of race.\n\nMore importantly, issuing a poor grade can result in a law suit which is very expensive & risky for both the teacher and the school district.  Juries have been known to hand out ridiculous awards because a poor grade was given.\n\nSo...  The Teachers with the tactic approval of the school district don't hand out poor grades to avoid the trouble.   This of course leads to a poorly educating student being advanced to the next grade where they are even worse off.\n\nIn most of the State Universities there are remedial classes for basic literacy and math.  Its a crazy situation that the country has worked itself into.  At this point grades and diplomas mean almost nothing (even though most people like to pretend this problem doesn't exist) because so many have been automatically advanced from one year to the next.",1670747565,t1_izrg83n,/r/anime/comments/zi7vno/rewatch_the_melancholy_of_haruhi_suzumiya/izrjljx/

I don't know what the real shape and center point of the curve should be, the only thing I am sure of is that there has been a lot of grade inflation over the last 50 years, and grades no longer mean much other than the student did attend class.\n\n>a lot of those professors should never have been teachers,\n\nlol, I gotta agree about this, I could tell you tales.

Anime,izpu298,zi6g4l,"**First Timer**\n\nIn the previous episode, we learned that the biggest Mylene fan is the total creep, who doesn't care about her feelings, and instead is interested in one thing and one thing only. Obviously, I'm talking about Guvava. The guy even made a shitty plushie of him! Can you believe the indecency? Yeah, I too am lost for words. Even the hospital didn't make him learn his lesson.\n\nAnyway, enough about him, let's check out today's episode.\n\n* Capturing a Protodeviln? But you already did that, and it ended up being completely useless. How about instead you go back and try to recover parts of Gigil's or Valgo's bodies, to maybe learn what they are made of and how you can kill them? They might be hard to find in the rubble from the destroyed planet, but not impossible with future tech, I'm sure. [](#hardthink)\n\n* It's true that he warmed up to the military lately, but still, Basara actually going with this plan is so out of character for him. \n\n* Irreversible action? Is Gabil gonna transform into kaiju or something?\n\n* Wait, we're in a battle? [](#kotourashock) That was abrupt. \n\n* Wait, no. This is some kind of simulation. \n\n* Wait, wait, wait. So Rey and Veffidas *can* produce sound blasts? [](#haaaaaaah) This is literally the first time we're seeing this. Why they never did it in battle? It was literally never brought up before. And now they are casually doing it. What the fuck, show?\n\n* So, the issue is that Basara is too strong and cannot be contained? Understandable.\n\n* Gamling stepping from behind the three like a stalker was weird. Not sure why they made the scene like that.\n\n* Basara has become addicted to space. \n\n* Veffidas eyecatch! [](#rengehype)\n\n* I don't understand how this sound cage works from the geometry standpoint. The visual doesn't make much sense, but I guess, it works somehow. [](#nyanpasu)\n\n* Is that the record for how fast Gabil lost his mech?\n\n* What? Fusion? [](#jawdrop)\n\n* Noo, not like this. [](#frustration) Why didn't you two do some kind of fusion pose, you had such a golden opportunity!\n\n* Wait, why are you thinking that Macross Cannon would work on this thing? You saw what it takes to kill a Protodeviln, you basically need an energy amount, capable of ripping apart a planet. I'm pretty sure, a single Macross Cannon is not even close to being that powerful. If you had 10 Macross ships all shooting together, than maybe we could talk about it, but this will just do nothing.\n\n* Yup, like I said, it did nothing. [](#indexsmugshrug)\n\n* Mylene, don't just watch while Basara is getting killed, start singing.\n\n* It's Sivil! [](#SPORTS)\n\n* Well, this should've been a hype moment, but it was severely gimped by sub-par art and directing. \n\n* Wait, they split again? But I though it was irreversible? [](#bigshock)\n\n* So, Sivil used a bunch of Spiritia to shield Basara, and now she's on the run again? Makes sense.\n\n* Abrupt ending, as always. \n\n**Overall thoughts:** I swear to god, this director just cannot direct action scenes. He makes them anti-fun. After this show, he shouldn't be legally allowed to come near action anime ever again, I'm personally willing to file a restraining order against him.\n\nAnd yes, I realize that there are multiple directors working on the show. In my eyes, it just means that they all have failed spectacularly and should retire from action shows and only direct horny fansevice romcoms from now on. How can you take a story like this and make the action so un-fun? You have a fusion, and it doesn't even have animation. A resulting creature also is barely animated. You have a beam battle, but it is drawn in such a way, that it's hard to even see what is happening. A big fun of beam battles is the tug-of-war between two beams, and instead of that, we got [this cut](https://i.imgur.com/ODU8ErD.jpg), which is just horrendous compositionaly, and has like two frames of animation. And then, there was a capture situation, which was just Grabil standing still with some bland special effects around him. And don't even get me started on the Macross Cannon shot. It comes out of nowhere, with zero buildup, no transformation sequence, no nothing. You just immediately know that it's gonna fail.

Anime,izpt8qi,zi6g4l,"*A Macross Fan Rewatches Macross 7: Episode 42:*\n\n- Exsedol really is pointing at the Wrestlemania sign by saying that there were only 7 Evil-series were made, and that there’s some still unaccounted for. Given that we had Valgo die not too long ago, I suppose it really is time to find something that can fill that gap.\n\n- l’m sure you could make some kind of horseshoe theory joke about how the UN Spacy wants to capture a Protodeviln with Anima Spiritia and how the Protodeviln want to capture Basara to study his Anima Spiritia, but I’m kind of drawing a blank. We could probably make a Spider-Man point at himself meme out out of this episode plot, at least.\n\n- Even this far into the series, Basara is still having a hard time working perfectly in synch with Sound Force, this time not even trying to match his singing to Mylene’s during the capture operation practice. I suppose we never really got a full resolution to him being shown not really appreciating teamwork, now that I think about it. It’s just been slightly smoothed over and pushed to the side this whole time. The situations we’ve been seeing just haven’t made the issue that prominent.\n\n- “Square up, Mylene.” —Gamlin, basically.\n\n- And so, the teamwork issue is solved by… Mylene moving in a bit closer. That’s really it. I mean, it doesn’t really solve any underlying issues, but it does synchronize the beams of Sound Energy, so whatever works I suppose. At least it shows that Mylene is brave.\n\n- Surprise! Like a stock shonen villain, Gabil wasn’t even using his full power before now. Behold, his true fused form with Grabil: Gabigula! Gabil is basically now a feathery Gundam head crest on Grabil’s body.\n\n- Of course now that Battle 7 fired its Macross Cannon again, it did absolutely nothing against Gabigula except singe some feathers. Although I guess that’s kind of to be expected from a Protodeviln that can apparently casually blow up moons with their shockwave. That’s really on the same level of power we saw Gigil have in his true form.\n\n- Well, Sivil’s rescue is a bit of a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it did save everyone from Gabigula, but on the other, she instinctively started to drain Basara of Spiritia before feeding off other other pilots. I suppose it was hard for her to control her instincts, since she looked to regret it before flying off.",1670713239,t3_zi6g4l,/r/anime/comments/zi6g4l/do_you_remember_love_macross_franchise_40th/izpt8qi/

It's not like her to... not be doing anything.\n\nExsedol's out of his bridge spot.\n\nAnd there you have it, folks: seven Protodeviln. That's all there are. Or at least, all that were sealed \nby the Protoculture using Anima Spiritia. Two are dead, and there's one unaccounted for, as well as Geppelnitch's true form.\n\nBasara doesn't like the plan of capturing a Protodeviln. What a freaking shock.\n\n...that was a quick turnaround. What part of that convinced him?\n\nThe thing is, Basara's right: we do know the Protodeviln are not pure evil. Gigil was capable of love for another. \n\nGabil has a dangerous plan? And I'll say Geppelnitch can't afford to lose more minions, if there are only five Protodeviln \nleft at all, counting himself.\n\nFor a second there I thought they were actually against Gravil, not a hologram.\n\nHmm, I think they added a little bit of dissonance in the song here, perhaps just to fit with the story? It sounded like Basara and \nMylene were just slightly off in their timing.\n\nThat's a dangerous tack to take, Gamlin. You know how prideful Mylene can be... yep. Though I expected her to get mad and yell at \nhim, not just run off.\n\nWell, look at that, Basara DOES own a spacesuit!\n\nI know it's a consequence of reused footage, but how does this fleet have any VF-11's left after all the losses we've seen?\n\nLooks like Mylene is actually taking Gamlin's advice and trying to up her own singing.\n\nThat's... actually kind of a clever idea. If she gets closer to the Protodeviln, her relative power will go up. If you can't win \nwith raw power, then win with math!\n\nGeppelnitch is in fortune cookie mode now too. \n\nAnd there goes Gabil's ship. Again.\n\nAnd here's the ultimate trick of Gabil's: GATTAI DA!

Anime,izpcf22,zi3c0e,"Hello guys. Holofan4life here happy to participate in yet another Toradora rewatch thread.\n\nToradora is my favorite anime of all time. As such, I know the series like the back of my hand. I’m going to analyze each episode BEFORE I actually watch the episode. And then after I watch it, I will give my real time thoughts on the episode. But I won’t be analyzing the episode as a whole. You fine folk do such a good job with that already. I will be analyzing a certain character from each episode and give some thoughts on what’s going on in their head. I thought that would be something different and fun.\n\nAlso, I am bringing back the ranking of the episodes. It’s been such a while since I last done it, I figure why not do it again.\n\nWith that out of the way, let’s begin.\n\nCome on. You know. You know who I’ll be analyzing today. It’s all about the Ami, baby.\n\nAmi is to Toradora what Valerie is to 90210. She makes a great show even better just by her presence. Toradora would be your run-of-the-mill romcom, except Ami lit the match and set that whole idea on fire.\n\nI’m gonna have a fun time analyzing Ami because you can tell she’s not really about making friends. She’s all about getting people to idolize her and worship the ground she walks on. Ami is like all the worst attributes of Taiga that Taiga’s classmates speculate her having. Once again, proving you should never judge a book by its cover.\n\nI of course really like the beginning scene where Ami is trying her damndest to act like the sweet innocent girl next door. And the scary thing is, it’s actually believable. Anime has had a long line of ditzy, foggy minded characters, especially when it comes to harem/romance anime. So when Toradora introduces a seemingly ditzy character, that’s what you’re expecting, as we already have a genki character as well as a tsundere. But as soon as Ryuuji leaves the table, she becomes an entirely different person.\n\nSee, she doesn’t mind showing her true colors around Taiga. That’s because she’s not trying to impress Taiga. She’s trying to impress Ryuuji. Ami knows if she keeps up with the charade, she’ll probably have her wrapped around her little finger. Because there’s nothing more perfect than a hot girl that’s attainable.\n\nAnd then of course in the classroom scene, Ami is like a kid in a candy store. She’s like a dog being in a room with a 100 mailman. They’re practically falling over each other praising Ami because they know she’s the model girl, and they want to hang out with her. And she relishes in it because she loves to be popular. I think with the scene with Taiga and Ami sitting alone in the booth, Ami I feel like can tell she can’t pull the wool over her eyes. That’s why she doesn’t even try. But with the other classmates, they are so enamored with her because they know her as that girl on TV that it’s easy to not show her true colors. They’re ripe for the picking.\n\nAnd then finally, with the scene where Ami lies to Taiga about Kitamura, this is her trying to state her dominance. She sees Taiga as a threat and someone who could possibly expose her, so she does what she can to pick at her? Does she honestly care about hurting her feelings? I don’t think so. I don’t think Ami knows Taiga enough to harbor a grudge. But just like a shark who smells blood in the water, she makes sure to try and tackle one of Taiga’s weak points to show how superior she is.\n\nThe genius of Ami as a character is that she helps evolve the other characters. That’s later on her purpose, which we’ll get to. The other genius of Ami is that by comparison, she makes Taiga far more likable. Compared to Ami, Taiga is like a saint. Ami makes Taiga seem like Minori. The show makes the conscious decision of having a character who’s nastier than Taiga so that you can have someone you can root against when they butt heads with her, and it just works so well.\n\nThe last thing I want to touch on is the scene with the vending machines. While I think Ami is still trying to put on the ditzy act to win over Ryuuji, that scene is the one part of the episode involving her where I feel the true her really comes out. Yes, she is still doing the act. And yes, you could argue her blunt attitude in the booth scene with Taiga is her true personality. But I think there’s a lot of truth in what Ami is saying about a lot of girls hating her making her stronger.\n\nAmi comes from the world of modeling. It’s a very cutthroat business, with people always gunning for the top by any means necessary. It wouldn’t surprise me if Ami created this alternate persona so that she can deceive others and make sure she ended up at the top. To extend on this theory, maybe Ami felt she had no other choice but to create the fake personality so that she’s less prone to getting hurt. Kinda similar to Taiga seemingly driving people away by her violent antics so that she doesn’t get hurt. Maybe in actuality, Taiga and Ami have more in common than they realize.\nJust some food for thought.\n\n**Post episode discussion**\n\nOverall, this is a pretty great episode, and in my opinion probably the second most important episode in the entire series. It really sets up a lot of themes that will be prevalent throughout the rest of the show, in particular being something you’re not. We already got that theme a bit with Ryuuji and Taiga not being as awful as their reputation suggests, but Ami takes it to another level by intentionally being something she’s not. This sets the tone for characters wearing masks, which we also saw a bit with Minori in episode 3.\n\nBecause the character I analyzed was Ami, there’s not much else to say about this episode. It is really ultimately about Ami and not really anyone else. Couple things I want to note are I think it’s adorable to see Taiga actually try to help Ryuuji out around the house more. It shows how much she wants to play an active role in Ryuuji’s life. Second, when Taiga slapped Ami across the face, if you look carefully, there actually was a fly. She wasn’t joking. Third, I guess Kitamura’s friendship with Ami set him to fall in love with Taiga. He must love aggressive girls. But if that’s the case, why didn’t he fall in love with Ami? My theory is Kitamura wants to end up with the real deal rather than someone who’s disingenuous. Kitamura tolerates Ami because he knows deep down inside lies probably a good person, but he doesn’t want to be with someone who’s always putting on an act.\n\nOne last thing I want to make note of that I didn’t pick up on in my previous rewatches is the sound design is exquisite. It really helps make jokes land. Taiga shoving the magazine in Ryuuji’s face, Taiga turning Ryuuji’s head, the sound of Ryuuji’s neck cracking as he turns his head back around, the sound design adds a level of humor to the show that the show would be missing without it. It’s really stellar stuff.\n\n**Episode Rankings**\n\n1. Episode 2\n2. **Episode 5**\n3. Episode 4\n4. Episode 1\n5.

Anime,izpdhna,zi3c0e,"### Rewatcher\n\n## Toradora! - A Romance Classic: [Episode 5](https://imgur.com/ocNm6La)\n\n_Model Student_\n\n...wow that's a bad pun\n\nAmi is interesting. I hate her character, but she brings an unexpected dynamic to the show and is vital for reasons I can't say yet. I guess a way to describe her would be duplicitous. She acts all clumsy and cute to get people to like her, while being conniving and mean when nobody _important_ is looking.\n\nThe fact that our protagonists know what she is doing makes the interactions engaging. Taiga is originally hurt by the thought Kitamura may hate her. But all it took was Ryuuji telling her that Kitamura knows about Ami's true character to cheer up Taiga.\n\nDuring my first watch I know my big question at this point was ""When will Ami be punished for her actions"". But I think the better version of my question is really ""Is her personality actually 'wrong'"".  \n\nOf course lying is amoral. But at the same time, its extremely rare to find somebody that acts the same around everyone. You'll discuss different topics and be more polite when at a formal meeting versus when speaking to close friends and family. I like the analogy of wearing a mask. Its also a big part of Japanese social norms ([本音と建前](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honne_and_tatemae)) which is what I think Ami's character right now is an exaggeration of.\n\nThe other side of that is why does she act this way?

For now, lets just watch what she does.\n\n### Some Amazing Shots, Scenes and Stitches\n\n* [Childhood Friends](https://imgur.com/s7ZKlcR)\n* [Spit Take](https://imgur.com/EYtemBZ), mods why isn't this a comment face\n* [Cute Girl Detector](https://imgur.com/emU8FO7)\n* [Thoughts](https://imgur.com/aGMlo4E)\n* [Cocoon](https://imgur.com/DJ8tbeW)\n\nSee you all tomorrow!",1670706338,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpdhna/
Anime,izpdm3u,zi3c0e,"###5th Time Dub Rewatcher. 2nd time reading the books.\n\nFinally we get to meet Ami. She’s a really interesting character. She’s got a mean streak and she puts up the perfect, nice girl facade, but there’s more to her than that.\n\nIf you’re watching in sub or with captions, you might miss this (because it’s hidden behind the captions). When Taiga slaps Ami in the face, she really did kill a fly and it’s on her hand afterwards. The first time I watched it I thought she made up a fake excuse to slap her in the face lol.\n\nIt’s amusing watching Ami think she’s got Ryuuji wrapped around her finger. She has a lot of internal monologue about this in the book.\n\n[Nightmare fuel](https://i.imgur.com/srUlGu3.jpg)\n\n[The book illustration is also hilarious](https://i.imgur.com/pGYj8i5.jpg)\n\n###On to the books!\n\nEpisode 5 ends right at the end of book 2 chapter 3. This episode is a pretty faithful adaptation of the first half of book 2 aside from dropped details and minor scene changes.\n\nOne thing that was a bit different is the part where Taiga is waiting in the classroom for Ryuuji to clean out her locker. Ryuuji was outside of the classroom the whole time listening to what Ami was saying to Taiga so he was already aware of what had happened. Ryuuji had already talked to Taiga about Kitamura having seen the whole incident in the restaurant but it still bothered Taiga enough that she holed herself up in her apartment.\n\nAdditionally, the scene where Ryuuji comes over to Taiga’s apartment to get her for dinner is a bit more intimate. Her nest is on the couch in her living room instead of on the bed.\n\n>There was a moment of hesitation. But Ryuuji made up his mind and flipped over the top of the couch. Ryuuji held his knees and sat down beside Taiga, who was hiding in her nest like a baby cub.\n\nTaiga talks about her insecurities a bit comparing herself to Ami and then\n\n>she had a cooling patch stuck on her round forehead. She might have developed a bump. Ryuuji felt a sting in his heart, and mostly subconsciously, gently rubbed the patch. Taiga didn’t push his hand away.\n\nFinally, the incident where they catch Ami with all of the junk food. They see her before she goes into the convenience store and watch her stacking a basket. Even the clerk is staring at her amused.\n\nAnd here are some choice moments I highlighted while I was reading.\n\n>Taiga’s swaying, waist-length hair was softly tangled, the color of chestnut touched by smoke. Her delicate body was enveloped in a fluffy dress piled with lace. Paired with her figure, Ryuuji thought the unbleached overskirt left her with an elegantly volumized and cute— (interrupted by Taiga yelling at him lol)\n\n>Although Taiga wasn’t living with them, on their days off, they were together during the day. They were together at night. They were together while shopping. They had an unwritten rule that she wouldn’t stay overnight, but it wasn’t uncommon for them to doze off after dinner and keep each other company late into the night. They were pretty much living together, but they weren’t involved, not as a couple, anyway. But as Taiga stood up, Ryuuji dawdled, lingering behind her.\n\n>It might’ve had something to do with the accidental way he found out about how brave Taiga really was, or how she was pretty much an underdog, but he felt like he’d pick Taiga’s personality over Ami’s every time.\n\n>This definitely wasn’t him throwing away a chance at a girlfriend in order to take care of Taiga—definitely not. He was just cleaning up something that Taiga had made a mess of. Taiga had made an unbelievable blunder, and he was just picking up the pieces—that was it. He just wanted to be by her every day so that he could instantly cover for her. So Noto was wrong.",1670706386,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpdm3u/
Anime,izprqsd,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher**  \n  \nToday we learned that indeed, the most dangerous hair color in Toradora is blue. Sumire gave off a very bossy impression and now we got a really big handful of a girl that is Ami Kawashima. But with her, our OP crew is complete at last!  \n  \nThe funniest moment for me - and I haven't noticed it until this rewatch - was when Taiga and Ryuuji were meeting Kitamura and Ami at the restaurant. Taiga forcefully turns Ryuuji's head to the entrance where the two stand. Afterwards, when he turns his head back on Taiga, you just have that incredibly painful crunchy sound as if the bones had to get back to a normal position. Ouch. It was such a freaky detail, I had to laugh.  \n  \nOh well, the fun won't last that long. Quickly it shows that Ami's true personality is not the cute airhead but a manipulative ""princess"" who pretty much just provokes Taiga whenever possible. I think her vanity is also insane. It's not because she's a model but just because Taiga is the least bit interested in her in the beginning, I'm sure of it. After Kitamura left, she didn't change her gears when Ryuuji was still on the scene.  \nThe fact that Kitamura hasn't told Ami that the school she's transferring to is the same as Taiga's also made her true nature come out since she could assume it's a one-off encounter where she doesn't have to uphold her fake personality. In that regard, it's a really clever thing for Kitamura to do. How he can stand Ami is hard to imagine with the behavior we've seen but there must be something and sooner or later, we may find it.  \n  \nWhat makes it bearable for us viewers is that Taiga isn't a mere victim, she trades blows with her in a different way by being raw and not keeping up an appearance. While she does fight back, the jabs from Ami definitely leave scars or at least make her very vulnerable afterwards. She at least shows that to Ryuuji and it's a really nice touch to see how trusting they've gotten over the course of the series so far already. I want someone with the reliability and care of Ryuuji but I wish for a more careful choice of words.  \n  \nThat was what I thought I'd expand upon for this episode. Off to the random notes:  \n- Yasuko MVP! Just telling her son to get Taiga for dinner. She feels very aloof and clumsy but she cares. She really values her.  \n- The scene in the classroom after school was tense. Ami *really* wanted to get under Taiga's skin and threw everything and the kitchen sink at her to achieve that goal. Taiga was hit but she also traded a blow by keeping an eye on her and her fake act. She looks so nonchalant and bored when saying it. It's some psychological warfare there and it already looks like scorched earth is the way to go.  \n- [There *is* a dot](https://imgur.com/3QNOe8c) on Taiga's hand after hitting Ami. Maaaaaybe she was saying the truth about the mosquito/fly, who knows.  \n- There's this cliché that main protagonists always sit on the window side. By that logic, [Ami](https://imgur.com/ArGaxHv) and [Kitamura](https://imgur.com/mPTpvcj) should be the main protagonists! [Ryuuji](https://imgur.com/ArGaxHv) has to have both columns next to him animated for extra work, [Minori gets to chill](https://imgur.com/DHal0Oe) door-side and Taiga is also between two columns.  \n- Continuing seats: with all the shots so far, you can map out for each student, how they look and where they're sitting. I checked the [2nd episode](https://imgur.com/3Nlksb0) and the seat positions are consistent. [Maya's seat](https://imgur.com/1TAs3gS) being empty in this screencap top right is also a great detail. It's quite a lot of work for characters who'll likely never play a big role and they have different looks.  \n- Everyone turns to Minori when she does her thing and [Kitamura doesn't notice](https://imgur.com/mPTpvcj) any of the commotion at all. Certainly straight-laced, role model student!  \n- Calling oneself an airhead is a red flag assumingly. I can kinda see where that sentiment is coming from.  \n- [Definite spoiler]>!If someone should know about playing a facade, it should be Minori. Heh. Good person to ask the airhead question, Ryuuji. This scene in hindsight is so much foreshadowing, it hurts. Same with Ami being ticked off after Taiga threatens her to keep an eye on her like a stalker.!<  \n  \nThis is one hell of an introduction episode for a character and damn does Ami make an impression!

Anime,izpz1l6,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher**\n\nAnd with this episode the main characters have been assembled. I'm not really a fan of Ami, her personality does its job in getting on my nerves and it's definitely on full display here. I'm really glad we didn't have to spend a whole episode just to dramatically discover her true nature like some other shows.\n\nOther observations I made:\n\n- I really appreciate the snark Ryuji showed Taiga this episode. It really shows how much their relationship has deepened, to the point that he feels comfortable throwing jabs at her now.\n- Bit of a tangent here, but I've always found the way that anime portrays ""model"" characters to be a bit confusing. Sure I guess Ami is pretty, and she's certainly drawn that way, but that classification applies to basically every other female character we see. It's probably just a symptom of the art style but I struggle to make the distinction between ""pretty"" and ""average"" anime girl a lot and it kinda screws with my suspension of disbelief.  \n- Ah yes, the unexpected horror that is Junji Ito Minorin face.\n- I think it's a bit strange Ryuji didn't mention to Taiga that Kitamura was aware of Ami's nature earlier, especially since I think he's usually pretty alert to this kind of stuff, but I guess he did get cut off earlier. \n\n**Bonus**: Despite my personal opinions, She works as an excellent foil to Taiga though so her inclusion in the story is still a positive.",1670715936,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpz1l6/

He acted like she threw acid at his face. \n\nI get that Taiga doesn’t see Ryuji in that way, but saying “gross” when Kitamura asked if they were on a date is just harsh. \n\nTaiga actually had a fly on her hand after slapping Ami, if you ask me, she didn’t do anything wrong. Plus provoking the most violent character on the show isn’t a super smart idea. \n\nRyuji just gave up trying to let Taiga know him and Kitamura know what actually happened after she ignored him once. He could have saved her from a lot of problems later this episode. \n\nI’m sure it was supposed that she tripped on something while walking, but it just looks like she was standing still and somehow managed to wipe out. \n\nIt’s against school rules to get drinks after lunch, but that’s exactly what Ryuji was about to do. Maybe he actually is a delinquent thug after all for rebelling against the school like that. (That rule is extremely stupid, I can’t imagine anyone would actually enforce it)\n\nMan how many times do they have to tell everyone that they’re not dating. Taiga’s best friend should know that better than anyone.  \n\nHaruta has some game if he can pull three girls at the same time while also letting Ryuji and Noto meet them too. What a team player. \n\nTaiga is really letting a lot of stuff slide from Ami without attacking her. If anyone else said those kinds of things to her they’d be in the hospital right now. \n\nRyuji is great at cheering Taiga up, until he’s not. He turned Taiga’s mood completely around, and then had to shoot her down again when he reminded her of Ami and Kitamura’s history. \n\nI’m not sure if this is going to make sense, but I always viewed this as the official start of Toradora. I always saw the first 4 episodes as introductions, and now I feel like we’re past that now and onto the meat and potatoes of the show.",1670705950,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpchii/

Anime,izpmp36,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher (very new), Subbed**\n\nA NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES!!\n\nAmi is a great addition to the show. I wasn't sure at first (she's so awful in this episode you're sort of just inclined to hate her), but its always worth it to hold off judgement before you get to see the character for more of the show. \n\nI said yesterday that the emotional core of the show for me is the ""fantasy vs reality,"" but I think the concept of personal masks, ""true self vs projection"" is really important too, and they're interconnected. Ami is, *obviously* a key to the masks concept. Its funny how, although her ""true personality"" is harsh and tough to appreciate, but once you know it, her fake personality is SO MUCH worse.\n\nIt's really sad, later in the ep, seeing more of how Taiga feels about herself.\n\n\[Toradora!\] >!Rewatching the Ami-Taiga classroom scene was interesting - first time it felt a little unclear what ticked Ami off about what Taiga said, but now its clear. Taiga accidentally hit on Ami's fear of her stalker. Yikes.!<",1670710234,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpmp36/
Anime,izpqbuc,zi3c0e,"Rewatcher\n\nThat double spit take is a great comedic moment. Nice of Kitamura to say up front that they were friends rather than anything else. We finally meet Ami Kawashima, the final named character in the opening.\n\nAmi's acting performance sure is something - also pretty shitty being that forward when she thinks that Ryuuji and Taiga are dating. Taiga is not the sort of person to stand for that shit though, love the disinterested response, switching to the slap at the mention of her height (which Taiga referenced about herself earlier) clued Ami into a weak point though.\n\nClass openly celebrating Ami switching in, Midori is on the case though. Love Ami's reponse to seeing Taiga is in the same class as her though, realises things aren't going to be as simple as she thought, hence her damage control attempt at the vending machines. Thanks to Kitamura, Ryuuji isn't buying it now though. \n\nKitamura playing a long game to help improve Ami's personality is an odd approach to being a friend but fits in well with what we know about him. He fell for Taiga because she was open about how she felt about things. Its a quality he values, so it makes sense that he would want Ami to be more honest with people.\n\nTo have the multiple personas and generally be able to get away with it shows that Ami is actually quite intelligent, in order to be able to keep the versions of herself appropriately (in her mind) separate and she would probably be quite successful regardless. Her modelling career would have impacted on her ability to have multiple personalities as well in a way that most people wouldn't need to deal with. \n\nPart of Ami's airhead persona involves clumsiness which she uses to get positive attention. Taiga, who is actually clumsy, often has bad things happen as a result of that, so I can see the difference in response there also pissing Taiga off. With an example later in the episode with the locker. Also, Ami randomly throwing herself to the ground would be so odd in real life (I guess she could've been stretching or something), but I guess thats why it happens off camera.\n\nThe notes from Taiga and Minori are interesting. We know why Taiga doesn't like Ami but its a mystery to everyone other than the four who were at the diner. The class would've been aware of the note and seen Ryuuji's response, along with Ami and Ryuuji returning late to class, and Ryuuji spending a lot of time with Taiga the rumour mill will start churning again. Most importantly, and bad for Ryuuji is that Midori clearly thinks that he and Taiga are in a relationship. Midori's response to Ryuuji's question is great though.\n\nAmi and Taiga both get some good insults in during their argument in the classroom. I would give the first round to Ami, but Taiga is developing a plan. Ryuuji probably should have told Taiga that he and Kitamura knew what Ami was like that first night at the diner when she was complaining.\n\nA bit of intrigue when we see Ami walking with junk food and dressed down to end the episode. \n\nYasuko is great as always.\n\nAs to whether I like Ami, initially I didn't - both from this episode (which seems pretty clearly to be intended) and for a good part of my initial watch of the show. Having seen the series multiple times now, I would say she is my second favourite character behind Taiga.",1670711890,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpqbuc/

Anime,izpg5wx,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher -5-**\n\nThis time I realized I can post at 10 PM local, not 1 AM like last year. That makes everything a lot easier :)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Ami episode\n\nWe start of at golden week, which gives us a very good indication how much time has passed.\n\nSchoolyears in Japan start on April 1st, and Goldenweek is around the end of April and beginning of May.\n\nSo about a month has passed between EP 1 and EP5.\n\nI'm not going into translating the TV or the advertisment, either because it's irrelevant dribble or I'm not entirely sure what they are trying to tell us. I'm still learning Japanese, so I'm not able to explain more difficult concepts.\n\nAnyway, the ad foreshadows Amis introduction, as will Taiga reading the catalogue in the café, right before Ami enteres.\n\nAnd I have to say the cartoony ""moving the head and spitting out at the same time"" also happened in the novel.\n\nTakemiya sensei didn't take her work tooo seriously.\n\nAmi calls herself ""Ami-chan"". There is really not a more anime-style way of talking about yourself. She reaaaly thinks she is hot stuff, or she wouldn't adress herself this way.\n\nThis whole scene is of course meant to introduce the 2 sides of Ami, which might look petty now, but has a reasonable foundation behind it, as we will see later.\n\nI don't remember if this is just an artifact of the german dub, but Ami also claims that this town is pretty boring. I think this is somewhat important as the anime takes inspirational shots from Tokyo wards, so you might think we are in the Tokyou-to area.\n\nBut I don't think that's the case if she claims that. The outer burrows of Tokyou-to can be sparse, but it's still not that far into the more interesting districts like Shibuya or Shinjuku.\n\n**大橋,** which means ""Big Bridge"", the town the story takes place in, is IMO located somewhere in the Kanto region, but not in Tokyou-to.\n\nI'll explain later why I think this is, besides the fact that Ami is bored about the small town she is in right now.\n\nThe title of this episode is just ""Kawashima Ami"" in all-kana, so there is no point in analyzing this.\n\nAmis Kanji are quite straight forward:\n\n**川嶋　亜美**, with Kanji for ""river"", ""island"", ""Asia, next"" and ""beautiful"". The island kanji is a name-kanji variant, but it's still easy enough to recognize how it should be pronounced. The fact that both Taiga and Ami have ""river"" in their full names, even with different variants, might be an indication that they are not as different as it looks.\n\nI think it's quite interesting how she trys to lure Ryuuji back into a good standing with her. She is quite skilled with it, not gonna lie, this should usually work. The treat with the coffe, the little apology, the taking him by the hand, creating physical contact etc. This is quite the skillfull, and very feminine, way of luring someone onto ones side. If it wasn't for Kitamura telling him what's going on, I think Ryuuji would have been in the dark a bit longer.\n\nBut since Taiga is very special to him (I don't know if anything about Ryuujis past was already discussed, so I refrain from spoiling the reason why Taiga is special to him), this wouldn't have lasted anyway. Taiga is not a liar. Quite the opposite, it's her inabilty to put on a fake smile like Ami which brings her so much sadness.\n\nOnto Minorins letter: LOL for her using the word ""Transferstudent-chan""   \n\-> **転校生ちゃん**. Even Microsoft IME knows this word :)\n\nAnd her ""O then X"" motion is still as weird as it was the first time I've watched it. I think the explaination was that she agrees that someone who calles themself an airhead is not to be trusted (Agreed with the O-motion), but that wasn't the point (Disagreed with the X-motion).\n\nGnaa, and following that is one scene that was cut short from the LN. Basically Takasu's classmates wanted to get him to meet other girls then Taiga, since they really couldn't see him enjoying his time with her. Remember that Taiga is a lot more verbally abrasive in the LN.But he wanted to do that, and he thought to himself that cleaning up after Taiga for his whole life wasn't a bad outcome, since he carried so much guilt on him.\n\nThis wasn't a romantic thought , this was a thought of atonement. Taiga was special to him, but compared to Minorin, he didn't love her.\n\nThat was actually mentioned at the end of volume one, which would be the end of EP 2 in the anime.\n\nI'm pretty sure 2KBIR can tell you more about the novels, as he did a year long review of them, so he has way deeper knowledge then I do.\n\nThe confrontational scene between Ami and Taiga was also interesting, as it is quite enjoyable to see how Ami probes for Taigas weak spot.\n\nAnd suprisingly, taking Ryuuji from her is not something that she fears. As the bond between her and him is way too strong for Ami to disturb.\n\nBut we all know what would trigger her, and it does.\n\nLater on it turns out... when Ryuuji is there to cheer her up again: It's more the envy that triggers Taiga, not the fact she might badmouth her in front of Kitamura.\n\nBTW the stalker forshadowing bit was something that wasn't in the novels, but... as I said... is used for forshadowing in the anime.\n\nHow this plays out will be discussed at another point in time :).",1670707406,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izpg5wx/
Anime,izppupb,zi3c0e,"**Rewatcher, Dubbed** \n\nAmi is finally here! I might be slightly biased as she's a top three character for me, basically tied with the coleads, but even with that aside I really enjoyed this episode. \n\nTaiga and Ryuuji feel a bit closer this time, both in the way they interact but also by being more supportive of eachother. There could've been some forced conflict for example where Ryuuji got mad at Taiga for slapping Ami, but instead he was just sort of quietly there for her. Then he does it again at the end when he cheers her up in her apartment.\n\nGetting back to the focus of the episode, Ami's introduction, I think its very well done narratively. Despite their instant antagonism, Ami and Taiga have an interesting dynamic, both kind of lash out when threatened, but in different ways. Another aspect I like about it is that Ryuuji as our protagonist knows what Ami is doing from the beginning, rather than having it be a twist sometime down the line. Because Ryuuji has that understanding, he treats Ami differently than he probably would've, which alters the whole dynamic. The episode also does a good job of establishing Ami as more than just a rival or antagonist by hinting at her situation. It does also help that an established character vouches for her, she's not just a random character who drops in with no connection to the characters.",1670711671,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izppupb/

Anime,izrdw4j,zi3c0e,"(\*\*Rewatcher - First Rewatch\*\*)\n\nHere we got the introduction to Ami Kawashima! After yesterday’s arguably Kitamura-centered madness, we finally round out the main cast of Toradora!\n\nLet’s begin!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEpisode starts off with Taiga and Ryūji ready for breakfast. They’re eating some omurice. Taiga watches the news out of boredom since they couldn’t get together with Kitamura. They get into an argument about getting with Kitamura, and it ends with Taiga spilling all her soup on her dress. Talk about karma. Yasu opens her door to find them eating without her and she cries. It won’t be as tasty eating without them after all. Like how Taiga’s concerned with her.  After Ryūji calms his mom down, he offers to wash her dress and in return, ask Taiga predicts, take her to Jonny’s. Ryūji basically has to take care of two kids lol. Anyway after a brief shot of the cover of a magazine featuring our star of today, the intro plays.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey eat at Jonny’s. Ryūji is upset he didn’t get to see her beloved Kushieda and Taiga blinds him yet again. Fifth time already. Anyways she finds a bag really cute, though Ryuji misunderstands and thinks she’s talking about the outfit. She shoves the magazine into his face, and talks about how she’s vertically challenged since she has short legs, acting like it’s no big deal to her, but later on we find out that’s not true.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs they bicker, the star of the show arrives. Ami Kawashima, and joining her is Kitamura. Taiga and Ryūji spit out their water in unison, and as they approach, Taiga grabs him and shakes him. They’re so used to each other, they touch each other a lot without realizing it. This gets brought up in ep 14. Yusaku introduces Ami to the pair, Taiga wonders why Ami calls Kitamura by his first name, but is delighted to hear they’re childhood friends. Taiga seems to like her but that will soon change. Kawashima acts all airheaded for Ryuji, and he gets so uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs Kitamura heads to the restroom, Ryuji takes a quick glance at Taiga, she’s sipping her iced tea, but she looks a bit irritated at Kawashima. Maybe because she’s annoying or she’s getting too close to Ryuji.As Ryuji tries to get away, Kitamura stops him, knowing he’d do the same. Now that Ryuji’s gone, Kawashima can remove that airhead facade to let out some steam. First order of business, get Taiga to fetch her some iced tea. Of course, Taiga doesn't follow her, similar to how she is with another blue haired girl related to Kitamura. Next she tries to get Ryuji to do it, calling him her boyfriend, but Taiga doesn’t care either. As all this happens, Kitamura and Ryuji watch on. Kawashima hits home with her remark on Taiga’s height. Ryūji is quite surprised Taiga is holding back, thinking she would’ve let her have it, but before he can finish, he slaps the chihuahua in the face. He didn’t expect it, but he kinda did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Taiga is gorging herself at Ryūji’s, angry about Kawashima. She’s upset about Kawashima, and distressed that Kitamura will be upset by her. Ryūji tries to comfort her but she gets mad at him for making googly eyes at her, a hint at a possibility of jealousy. As she brushes some tears, she gorges on Ryūji’s food, saying she’ll suck it up since she’ll never see her again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe did see her again. Next morning, Kawashima transferred to Ohashi. Everyone is happy but our pair is shocked. As they transition into PE class, Kawashima is pretending to be an airhead once again. Taiga looks angrily while Minori uses her cute girl radar but picks up nothing. Ryūji and Kitamura watches on, and Kitamura explains how he’s never had a problem with her, he just wants her to have actual genuine friends being herself, and accepting that things might not go her way and not everyone will like her. Kitamura cares about Kawashima.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRyūji thinks about this, and as he heads to the vending machine, he meets up with Kawashima, trying to get him on her side to get back at Taiga. Ryūji’s tries not to fall to her tricks. She mentions meeting girls that just don’t like her, and she’s used to it. Ryūji’s doesn’t buy it, and he’s probably right since she can’t accept Taiga and she always tries to win everyone over. In 4th period, Taiga gives Ryūji a note asking why he was with Kawashima, she’s not too happy with him being with the chihuahua. He also gets a note from Kushieda, angry thinking he’s cheating on Taiga. She still sees Taiga and Ryūji as a couple no matter how much they deny it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter class is over, Ryūji is talking to best boys Noto and Haruta. They’re even inviting him to see some girls from the track team, but Ryūji’s got to attend to his girl instead. \[Toradora ep 23 spoilers\]>!Looking back, I guess it makes sense Haruta was able to get a girlfriend, Sena, since he was able to attract all these girls!<Taiga accidentally spilled what I presume to be milk on a locker. Ryūji cleans it and tells Taiga to go home if she wants, but she stays behind for him to finish. I like this brief moment. Shows how Taiga doesn’t want to leave Ryūji behind and alone. Most students probably would be out of the campus by the time he finished cleaning so he’d be all alone. Taiga patiently waits, and gets slightly happy when she thinks Ryūji is there, but unfortunately it's a different dog. Kawashima teases Taiga, saying how all the teachers dislike her, but Taiga doesn’t care and threatens her with stalking her, which hits home for Kawashima. Kawashima tries to threaten Taiga back with taking Ryūji away, but she doesn’t care either. Even if she may be jealous, she has seen Ryūji and knows he wouldn’t leave her all alone like that, and he probably won’t fall that easily for her. Kawashima isn’t ready to lose to Taiga so she threatens her with the knowledge that Kitamura “hates” her because of that incident. Seeing as how Kawashima is Kitamura’s childhood friend, Taiga would assume that as well. Ryūji enters and figures out something happened between the two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey go home, and Ryūji serves some meat this time around, probably since Taiga complained last episode. Ryūji mentions that food tastes better off the stove, and that sentence starts off very similarly to what Yasu said in ep 2 (this is gonna turn into a metaphor i swear). He wants Taiga to enjoy and eat with them. So he checks up on Taiga with a blue hoodie on. As he noticed Taiga curled up and crying, he cheers her up and reassures her it’s gonna be okay, saying he knows everything. Taiga trusts Ryūji and believes him, and Ryūji adds Kitamura isn’t the type of person to hate her over something so stupid. But Taiga wonders though, if that’s the case, if he doesn’t hate her, why is she tiny and why does she have a weird name. This isn’t the stuff Kitamura hates about Taiga, but it’s the stuff Taiga hates about herself. However, she pounces back up because of Ryuji’s speech, though he kinda fumbles the bag when he mentions how it doesn’t matter that Kawashima’s been long friends with Kitamura, which earns him a pillow to the face because Taiga’s sensitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYasu interrupts and asks for some sauce. Now that they’ve resolved this issue, Taiga is able to help and get Ryuji to buy the sauce to make the food taste better. He and Taiga are able to properly enjoy the food since he motivated her to come for dinner, like their togetherness was the sauce, (that’s definitely a reach. Bravo takemiya!!! Another food metaphor!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n…Anyways they buy some sauce at what seems to be a knock-off 7/11. This area is a breeding ground for lawsuits, first Sudoh-Bucks, now Fm11. They figure out Kawashima has quit modeling. As the episode ends, they wonder why and they see her walking down the street with a bunch of junk food. Ryuji wonders if there’s a party, but Taiga, knowing what it’s like to feed off convenient store food for ages and eating a lot because of irritation, knows she’s stress-eating. Gives us a real hint at Kawshima’s isolation, and shows how she and Taiga might not be too different.Overall, a neat episode. It introduces us to Ami, who moves the plot forward a lot.

Anime,izt6r30,zi3c0e,"First-timer, Dub\n\nThis episode was good. My favorite moment was when Ryuuji and Taiga both spat out their water as Yusaku and Ami walked in. They did a good job of building up to it by showing them taking big drinks simultaneously. \n\nI felt sad for Taiga because of how much Ami was able to tear her down, but at least we know that Ryuuji and Yusaku are not fooled. Hopefully Ryuuji continued to comfort her, beyond what we saw in the episode. \n\nI expect there will be some character development for Ami. She can't stay this evil the whole time. She'll probably remain the villain for a few episodes but then we'll get to see what's really going on with her, and then she'll be more sympathetic. I didn't know what to make of the end of the episode. All I could think was that she got all that junk food because she has some sort of eating disorder...\n\nThe dub cracked me up whenever Taiga would casually call Ami a bitch. I'm not used to that language in anime, and with Toradora's cute aesthetic and younger characters, there's a shock factor. The best moment was when Taiga and Ryuuji are walking and they notice Ami. Taiga shouts out, ""It's *the Bitch.""*  I'm not usually a fan of foul language, but this was funny.",1670781257,t3_zi3c0e,/r/anime/comments/zi3c0e/toradora_christmas_club_rewatch_2022_episode_5/izt6r30/

Anime,izpr72b,zi1yz3,"While it is disappointing I am somewhat glad it's not an anime adaptation. I really don't have high hopes for a proper anime adaptation especially when it would be made in a large part to cash in on the author's recent death. I hope some time passes and then a proper full adaptation is worked on. I currently feel like they wouldn't want to make another adaptation of the post-golden arc since 2016/2017 was recently made. Maybe in a couple of years when both the 2016/2017 adaptation and the movie trilogy are a bit older, we will get to see another adaptation that hopefully covers the entire series. Similar to how Hunter x Hunter, FMAB, and Shaman King took around a decade after their initial adaptations to get readapted. \n\nI think another couple of years will also really help the visual aspect of the Berserk adaptation. At this point in time, there is very little chance we would get an adaptation that doesn't have a large number of CGI monsters or large battles. CGI has been getting better quite quickly this last decade and I'm sure it will be even more impressive and well-integrated if the industry is given the proper time to really practice using and integrating it well.

Anime,izqkwiq,zi189x,"There's the influence of three factors that make that difficult for anyone now, but especially adults. First being that we got to experience things airing on TV which is an experience in itself to miss. Second being that it was quieter, something I don't mean in the sense of gatekeeping but just that the prospect of experiencing anime like it was an 'outside phenomenon' which wasn't as popular yet was also a certain type of experience that is no longer a thing in many countries now. And third which is exclusive to adults, is that nostalgia lies heavily in memories grappled from childhood, and less so from the ones made as adults.  \n\n\nThat said, at the very minimum, if I had to suspect or at least hope, I'll feel nostalgia with, it would have to be some things I experience in a unique way to how I normally would. Something that has memories linked to it outside just the experince of watching it plainly in my normal fashion. That can be anything. And with that logic, it's one I believe also entails the notion that everyone's 'nostalgic' series will be much more varied than in the past because of the enormous outpour of anime we get now. Moreso by the fact since nearly everyone watches whatever they want online, they're all watching different things.  \n\n\nThus far anything I watched even four years ago still feels very 'in the present' still. But on the offchance it DOES happen, then said animes I personally have specific memories tied to (and thus why these answers are random to anyone else):  \n\- Fruits Basket 2019  \n\- Case Study of Vanitas  \n\- Sk8 the Infinity",1670726767,t3_zi189x,/r/anime/comments/zi189x/what_new_anime_from_the_last_5years_will_give/izqkwiq/

Anime,izp47fq,zi13pn,">Clannad\n\nI hope you are not into tragic / sad stories, because this derpy faced anime is unironically unrivalled in the making you break into tears category (It's even sadder than AoT and Stein's Gate).  Otherwise you should be safe ignoring it.\n\n>HxH ... same with One Piece, Bleach, Boku\* no hero, and Naruto\n\nWhere's World Trigger?  You did watch it, right?  No fucking way you missed it, that would just be too much of a waste.  I can easily claim it is better written than all the other battle shounen you mentioned.\n\n>...reincarnated genre...Comedy...\n\nWatch ""Isekai Ojisan"".  You will find it is far more dramatic and serious than Mushoku Tensei  ***wink wink***\n\nThe best I can do is recommend, but I can't force you to open your eyes.

Anime,iztvk6a,zi13pn,"In case you're curious they were called waves. One of the focuses is seeing how he starts to regain his humanity and his relationship with Raphtalia (the slave) plays a big part in this. I don't want to give too much away but things change for the better in a lot of ways. My friend was kind of in the same boat as you. I really recommend you watch it to at least episode 5 or 6. \nAs for Toradora the relationship building I guess is what I like but also the humor. There are some real tear jerker moments. Not that that's my thing but I appreciate a show that can really grab your heart. Tsuderes can bug me sometimes but Taigi (the short one) grows on you, or at least for me she did. Actually all the characters did. They can seem to be ridiculous at first but as they are developed they don't seem so bad.  \nI can't said for sure if you'd like Toradora if you watched more but I'd be surprised if you didn't end up liking Shield Hero.",1670790683,t1_iztqkj5,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/iztvk6a/
Anime,izpb7qi,zi13pn,"Yeah, scumbag Toei really hid World Trigger from the west by trying to mangle it the same way they mangled One Piece.  Luckily seasons 2 and 3 were seasonal with drastically higher animation budgets.  You will pass out from the tactical RPG stratagems that await you (I almost forget we are talking about a battle shounen).  Despite World Trigger not being known in the west, it's actually mad popular over in Japan thanks to the manga.\n\nAnother comedy gem is actually airing this very same season.  ""Bocchi the Rock"" might give you the impression of it being as bland as K-on, but episode 1 swiftly dispels your fears by presenting you with the most relatable and charismatic idiot with pink hair.  Watch episode 1 at least.\n\n There's more good anime that I can fit in a single reddit post, but I can try name dropping some of the niche anime I loved.  Prod me for details if you have questions of any particular ones.\n\n""Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu: Die Neue These"":  Polite gentleman fighting over control of the entire galaxy.\n\n""Dragon Quest: Dai no Daibouken"":  Most of the villains are protagonists.  Also comes with a ""generic"" protagonist to start with.\n\n""Wakfu"":  It's a french anime, with a french dub, and an episodic ""kid's cartoon"" start.  But the animation quality and tone of the story pivots into a very exciting and dramatic campaign with a wide variety of villains ranging from a madman clock-wizard to a reincarnated lunatic.  I found the fight animation in particular to be very fun to watch.  The show and game franchise are all the rage inside of France, but virtually unknown in the rest of the world.\n\n""Yowamushi Pedal"":  Happy, silly, and blood pumping goodness.\n\n""Kaiji the Ultimate Survivor"":  It has humans falling to their deaths from skyscrapers, fingers being cut off, foreheads being grilled, kidnapping, slavery, and best of all, the villains are literal monsters and STILL relatable.",1670705426,t1_izp57kk,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/izpb7qi/

Pink hair sounds like that anime with the high school psychic guy that doesn’t talk (the disastrous life of “something”), huge missed opportunity because it would have added so much crazy and funny situations, like he comes up with absurd excuses to justify his powers etc. What about K-ON ?

Mainly because of the complete lack of subversion/surprises, that particular show is exactly what it advertises, uneventful days of 4 highschool girls hanging out.\n\nI perceived it to be incredibly bland, and I watched it in its entirety (really long time ago).\n\nI also hate the Dragon Quest videogames, the anime won me over purely from the mangaka's writing (big amount of unexpected twists starting from the middle of the anime).  The plot of the anime does not seem to follow the games at all, but the story is rather generic in the first 20 episodes at least (likely to contrast with the later unconventional developments).\n\nNo problem at all, and thanks for the offer, I'll keep it in mind.",1670942194,t1_j01ht7e,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j01zub2/

Anime,j03h9q8,zi13pn,"Just to add to your trivia.\n\nDragon Quest was actually the bastardization or simplification of the 'Wizardy"" franchise in an attempt to make the RPG videogames more accessible, easier to play, and therefore sell more units to increase profit in the japanese market (this was back when Japan only imported the overly awkward and complicated western RPGs and BEFORE any JRPGs existed).\n\nIn fact, MOST Fantasy or JRPGs, including your PS1 games likely descended from Dragon Quest (the first JRPG), which in turn was born from western Wizardry, which in turn came from Dungeons and Dragons, which in turn came from miniature wargaming (think plastic soldiers, measuring rulers, and lots of dice).\n\nDragon Quest is the definition of ""so intentionally casual and dumbed down that I want to kill myself"".\n\nExample article in case you ever feel like reading:  https://www.denofgeek.com/games/final-fantasy-first-jrpg-ever-genre-history/",1670963207,t1_j03egfx,/r/anime/comments/zi13pn/i_guess_i_hit_that_point_seeking_anime/j03h9q8/

Probably a combination of the art, the setting, the ""feel"" and (last but not least) the voice of the heroine.  \n\nPerhaps because Shouxue started so young as consort, it made her more prone to pick up support.  She is such a combination of steely strength and vulnerable young girl,  Not sure that I'll ever be able to pick one favorite show of this season (too many shows I love), but I think Shouxue is my clear pick for best character and Saku MIZUNO is my pick for most distinctive performance.\n\nDespite its (superficially) low-key tone, this show has been surprisingly stressful at times -- and no more so than with this cliff-hanger ending.  One has to assume poor Wen Ying is no more.  While Shouxue will assuredly not be defeated by the Owl, how much mental damage will she sustain if she wound up causing the death of a friend?\n\nWho is the Owl -- and why would he dare to try to destroy the priestess/avatar of a goddess?

Anime,izoo68a,zhwvlv,"Mostly a build up episode so a bit slower than others but still plenty enjoyable. I know a criticism towards the anime and its handling of Bocchi's development is the amount of outside help she receives, in this episode it was Kita the one that ended up turning the application rather than Bocchi getting over her fear. But I appreciate that Bocchi receives this as a positive, she is fully aware that she is being irrational in this fear but she deeply wants too. Its like the introductory narration in every episode of Komi-san that gets tiringg but is still true, ""just because they can't it doesn't mean they don't want to"".

Kita probably knew Bocchi would be indecisive, so someone has to take action instead of procrastinating.\n\nLast week, a fellow reddit user mentioned we already have a Bocchi x  Nijika and a Bocchi x Kita episode. This week, we have a mini Bocchi x Kukuri episode. I didn't expect Kukuri to be an introvert in the past too. Now she is inspiring Bocchi, notwithstanding the alcoholic behaviour.

Kita's extroverted and kind of impulsive, but she's not a glittery airhead; she's actually kind and sensitive. The whole setup when she first came back to the band would never have happened if she hadn't been ashamed and embarrassed about ditching them because she felt like she couldn't keep up.\n\nI really should have expected Kikuri to be in a psych rock band. It fits almost too perfectly. The strong bass chops, the extreme chill, the substance abuse, the odd moments of wisdom...

Anime,izqqp9d,zhwvlv,"In this episode we got to see some sides to the other side characters that might have been hinted at but were more obvious.\n\nKita showed she has a self-centered and manipulative side when she lied about thinking Bocchi threw her form out by accident. I don't mind this as I think it's not just meant as a lazy way too kickstart the plot but to show a side of Kita we haven't seen, the fact she feel regret and apologizes when she could have gotten away with the lie also adds another layer.\n\nRyo I joke is the character most like me in the show, but this episode I was like...\n\n""She's so like me Fr Fr""\n\nIt was how she was so proud for striking out on her middle school festival doing her own thing, but then reveals it does indeed hurt her, it shows a less cool more vulnerable side of her, and also shows her greatest strength and weakness, that at the end of the day she goes with being authentic and herself even if it costs her, and despite the pain of that cost, she won't hesitate to do it again and again.\n\nNijicha showed she can be as scary as her older sister with her ""fuck around and find out.""\n\nBocchu re-enforces (again) that she is secretly quite narcissistic but feels ashamed of it. I admit I'm a bit fed up with Narcissistic performers spouting stupid ass shit.....*cough* Jennifer Lawrence *cough* for the most recent example. But in a sense I think the kind of people that desire and become performers there is something in them that has to enjoy the attention and has a least a seed of Narcissism that just comes with the territory. I think Bocchi is very good at capturing this despite it being at odds with her social anxiety.\n\nThe Bassest Kikori I kinda guessed ever since the first concert performance where she showed up that she might have been very much like Bocchi and is indeed shy and socially anxious and her alcholism is an escape from that. I kinda hope there is a time where we get an arc of either she growing from that, or Bocchi has a moment where she makes an effort to not walk down that path, because tbh I'm worried for Bocchi.\n\nThe Other members of sick hack include a Gaijin Weeb, and a straight man to complete with the alcholic mess....yeah that tracks.\n\nAt least Bocchi got her loans paid back by Ryo and Kikori after Seikia made them.\n\nThe visuals to show the psychedelic effect was pretty good, especially given the historical context of the genre of rock being played.\n\nOf course Bocchi after all the courage ghosts them......I wonder if she'll be convinced to go on at the last moment, or if we get an interesting subversion. Seeing how the band did Cameo in Slow Loop I have my suspicions on which one it'll be.\n\nStill never thought the Bocchi cliffhanger would be competing with *Raven at the Inner Palace* and *Beast Tamer* this week for stressful cliffhangers.",1670729822,t3_zhwvlv,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izqqp9d/

Anime,izoy7d1,zhwvlv,"Anxiety can be a total bitch and sometimes absolutely need external help to overcome it. Its a vicious circle of 'I want to be more social -> proceeds to not do it out of fear' and the feedback loop becomes worse because talking down to yourself is so common so the sentiment of 'Why am I so shit' becomes worse and worse which also alienates people more and more.\n\nI tried to make my year goal to be more social and it was honestly being a failure until I landed a new job with very social coworkers that understand my desire to not interact with people sometimes but still want to do outings from time to time (as contradictory as it sounds, I'm also confused myself so dw, doesn't make much sense to me either).\n\nIt all depends on the context for me. Dragging me to a party despite me saying that I don't feel like it is not a vibe for me and I find it annoying because parties are something I'm decidedly not into. On the other side of things, I have expressed that I wouldn't mind being able to talk to women I'm attracted to without feeling like my feet are melting. I avoided talking to a girl for months and I kept making shit up about her disliking me based on my gigabrain analysis of the single 5 sentence interaction I had with her and these dudes kept talking to me about stopping being a coward and like I *know* I'm not going anywhere by being a coward but ohmylord, I get so fucking nervous. In the end one of them made a bet with me, I talk to her and try to do something within a timeframe or next time they plan something I can't say No. They tried their darnest on giving advise and the pressure certainly helped since I ended up talking to her...just to find out she had a boyfriend, but what matters is that I learned that *gasp* she was a normal person and I was shitting bricks all the time for irrational reasons. It was *such* a relief, I legit felt something leaving my body because I finally did something I had been stalling for years. God I felt so powered up.\n\nAnnnnnnnnnnnnnd I lost my train of thought yet again discussing Bocchi. Anyways, we know that in this episodes Bocchi did want to enter the festival but her anxiety got in her way. Her 'teleporting' to the poll to find out she herself wrote the app is pretty self-evident on this. If she were in autopilot she would have done it herself but anxiety kicked in and she became unable too, so Kita's action feels more in-line to 'I got your back' thing (thought she admits she just wanted to see Bocchi perform). Personally I would also appreciate it a lot...internally cause I also have problem being actually grateful towards others so I would jokingly say ""Unforgivable"" as well but chances are my friends know I appreciate it...yeah I can be a bit of a drag...",1670700101,t1_izoob2s,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izoy7d1/
Anime,izp3kkk,zhwvlv,"It's a very fine line. It doesn't feel like she acted out of condescending or selfish reasons.

Promo monkeys who listed him as Protagonist cause many to hate and drop RE: CREATORS because he was a failure as the protagonist and often not in scenes because he was not the protagonist or main character it an esamble drama and the white haired book carrying girl hero Meltora if anything is the protagonist after all it revield she wrote RE:Creators. \nDon't skip the recap episode it the best one I've ever seen staring Meltora who makes it told from her point of view and changes herself to a sex pot in the process. \n\nIt says something about pre conceived notions. Because descriptions of the show written by the Promo Monkeys call the first charter the protagonist people watching the show ignored the character in the show saying I'm not the main character other are I'm just the narrator. \n\nPromo people who put together the promotional material for a show  often do not seek any input from the people making the show and often ignore information they are given in order to make the promo better in their opinion.

Anime,izt05aq,zhwvlv,"I think that's Nijika. Kita is the one who spent all summer break hanging out with her *other* friends. Kita is empathic and wants people to like her (the foil to Ryou). I think Kita submitted the form because she thought the other 3 girls would like her for it. Why would she lie to Ryou and Nijika, then apologize to Gotoh? \n  \nKita really apologized because she felt she had been selfish and upset Gotoh. But actually Kita did something for others and Gotoh made her upset about it. Hence her apology is a little dishonest and if she were more direct then Gotoh would have to apologize for her toxic apathy. \n\nNot to overly bash any of them as all of the girls are still kids and have some character flaws. Gotoh can affect others with her gloom. Kita's need for approval can make her a pushover. Ryou's independence often makes her a ""bad friend.""

Anime,izyhbtq,zhwvlv,"I guess I might have been kind of unclear so if anyone still is reading this thread my main issues where that: \n\n1. Kita's decision to turn in the form has less context in the anime so it would be less clear to her that Bocchi actually wanted to perform. In the manga Bocchi doesn't immediately throw the form in the trash and Bocchi and Kita actually have a short conversation about the form while Bocchi is resting. Also, Bocchi doesn't actually throw it away until the day after. This means Kita would have had a much clearer idea it's actually something Bocchi wanted to do. \n\n2. The part with the coffin happens at school instead of starry and you also actually get to see Kita trying to retract the application. Some of the dialogue from that part was moved to starry instead but there was a panel with two random other students seeing Kita crouching next to the coffin and thinking Kita has become kind of weird after joining the band. I really really liked that one panel just because how funny I personally found a lot of the potential implications if you think about it (in the anime Starry could have had a coffin lying around, but in the manga Kita is the only one that could have brought the coffin so did she randomly go get a coffin from somewhere to put Bocchi in? Does the school have coffins lying around? And does other students acknowledging it mean they've randomly seen Kita do other weird stuff at school before? The panel also says three hours have passed since the previous part, so did Kita spend three hours getting a coffin for Bocchi or did she get the coffin quickly and then spend almost three hours watching over coffin Bocchi in a random hallway? Or did she go to class and just leave Bocchi like that until breaks rolled around? And why did she leave Bocchi lying in the hallway for three hours instead of moving her?)\n\nIt's a very insignificant detail in the grand scheme of things so I can get why it was skipped, but the first 9 episodes skipped very little and that kind of got my hopes up about seeing most of the fun smaller moments in the anime too.\n\nSo that's my main reason why I was kind of disappointed with the first part of the episode. I still liked it quite a bit, but if the first 9 episodes were a 10/10 then this one maybe felt more like an 8/10 to me (though obviously I probably wouldn't have minded if I hadn't already read the manga). \n\nAnd if you mean all the commas and parentheses, then yeah, I know I should probably work a bit on not using so many.\n\nAlso, thanks for actually answering instead of just downvoting! I'll keep in mind that I should try to explain more of my reasoning for why I feel stuff next time.",1670875005,t1_izxxxqy,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izyhbtq/
Anime,izq3t8z,zhwvlv,"Yeah, but I don't feel like I was being particularly rude about it and I don't think it's that weird for me to be a bit disappointed they skipped a part I like even if it's a great adaption overall (I mean, this is the source corner so I figure other people voting here would at least be aware the pacing in this episode is faster than several of the previous ones, and obviously other people are free to like that even if I would have preferred it to stay a little bit slower personally).\n\nSo I don't necessarily see how it makes sense for people to downvote because of that, especially since I for instance also feel like I see people mention stuff they like better and worse in the anime compared to the manga in the source corner of other anime without people necessarily being downvoted for having either opinion (and in this case this is also the only episode I wouldn't unhesitatingly say the anime version is better for even if it also had some cool additions, which makes me feel more like the anime did some things better and the manga did some things better for this one). \n\nEdit: and if any part of it does come across as rude or disrespectful I promise that's 100 % unintentional \n\nSo, the short version is that I'm confused about being downvoted for being a bit disappointed with skipped content in the source corner, where that kind of discussion seems pretty common for many other anime (at least those I've watched and read the threads for).\n\nAnd if this seems like a lot of overanalyzing to anyone reading this, then yeah, it absolutely is and my habit of doing that is part of why I find Bocchi very relatable sometimes (I'm obviously not always quite as extreme as her)",1670718207,t1_izp2eyd,/r/anime/comments/zhwvlv/bocchi_the_rock_episode_10_discussion/izq3t8z/

Anime,izoe889,zhwuck,"We now return to the thrilling and dangerous game of underground tennis as the Phony family takes on the Campbell siblings!  \n  \nThe only thing more amusing than how excessive the cheating attempts to throw Loid and Fiona off are is Loid and Fiona expertly adapting to them and still managing to turn the tables on the Campbells.  \n  \nA sniper? A sniper!? Although Fiona got to have Twilight take a hit for her, so it wasn't all bad. And they overcome everything thrown at them by expertly and majestically playing like a pair of drunks.  \n  \nMale Campbell taking the hit to the stomach but still getting back up to keep playing was surprisingly commendable of him! No wonder he took the loss as a point to grow on and was inspired by Loid, who responds in kind with some motivational speech. even Papa Campbell was happy this turned into a learning experience for his kids despite how much money he lost.  \n  \nOf course it can't be as smooth as them just getting the painting they needed as a reward, since state security is on the move, but Twilight and Nightfall are still expert spies and masters at subterfuge.   \n  \nThose are some snazzy WISE jackets!  \n  \nI love how Fiona talks about giving the jewelry to Sylvia and we actually see her wearing them in the briefing room.   \n  \nFiona has finally had enough of Yor hogging Twilight and her rightful position as matriarch of the Forger Family, and the only way to settle this is an impromptu tennis match! But the audience (and Loid) both know how this is going to go (and Yor is in this to win it).  \n  \nAnya confusing tennis with baseball is so Anya. As is her ordering Bond to get the tennis balls.  \n  \nAnya finally understands the appeal of romance dramas when she sees how exciting the tension between Fiona and Yor is. I guess that's one way to interest her in something that's not cartoons.   \n  \nYor murders tennis balls! And then shoots them like they're projectiles hurtling at the speed of light! It's actually kind of beautiful! Meanwhile Fiona has the most hilarious expressions on her face but manages to endure it admirably, powered by her love for Twilight. Of course the racket couldn't take so much power, so Fiona is left the loser. Not that she'll give up, even if it means her mask finally slipping and her turning into a blushing crying mess as she crazily drives away for a mountain training arc to learn how to hit back Yor's shots. Perfect cap off to Nightfall in this storyline.  \n  \nLoid talking about their marriage of convenience while Yor genuinely wants praise and acknowledgement for beating her love rival! You gotta love it.  \n  \nSo all this was because a husband wanted to keep his admiration and love of young and attractive actresses hidden for the sake of his family. In the end he was just a very embarassing and devoted father and husband, which Loid can kind of relate to now that he's acting as one. I love the expression on his daughters' face in the picture.  \n  \nHuh, Yor seems surprisingly serious at the end. Could she be contemplating her feelings for Loid?  \n  \nNext week: Anya and Becky Ooting! Damian!

Anime,izplr1f,zhwuck,"All those tricks - ALL those tricks, and at the end of the day, you just can't beat Loid and Fiona! The part where Loid tackles Fiona had me surprised. I saw it coming, but still, I was jumping up and down after that because I knew Fiona would get all excited about it. As much as I love Yor and ultimately support her, I still can't help but be happy when Fiona gets happy too.\n\nI also love how the already wild match gets progressively crazier and crazier. From the court manipulation we saw last episode, to raising the net, and then they start bringing in snipers and ballboys who are shooting chaff or something. At the end of it, the Foneys are doing so many weird tricks and spins that the announcer gives up and says he has absolutely no idea what they're doing anymore. ""Drunken boxing from the east"" had me on the floor. \n\nAnd though they win, Carol is a graceful loser. He even manages to get some praise from Loid, who tells him to practice honestly. \n\nThere is a small hitch in the plan. Despite being promised to be able to get anything out of Mr. Campbell's collection, the Lady in the Sun turns out to have been pockmarked by government officials for taking. I was wondering if Loid was hiding in the bag or something when Fiona walked in by herself, but no, he disguised himself as the butler and swapped the painting with a fake while no one was looking. Fiona ends up taking a few strange-looking trinkets and we later see Handler wearing them! I feel bad for the government guys. They'll be spending a lot of time looking on the fake painting for a code that does not exist.\n\nHowever, it's just as for naught here - turns out the secret the Colonel was hiding wasn't about some big East-West wartime secret but his love of theater idols. This man was a legit gacha player in the 1950s. \n\nJumping back a little bit, we have Fiona challenging Yor to a match as they head back to base to deliver the painting. Yor may not know that there was a secret mission, but knows that Fiona might be threatening her place as wife. The details are wrong in her imagination but she gets the basic idea. And then there's Anya thinking about Becky talking about Berlint Love. I feel Anya, I was thinking about that sort of soap opera battle right then and there too. \n\nDespite everything she has overcome, despite all the wild madness of the competition, it's regular housewife Yor in a friendly and crude casual match that manages to be the wildest. First she annihilates the ball (can we get an F for Mr. Ball?) and then she launches a freaking missile of a serve at Fiona. I totally saw that racket break incoming btw - Fiona's love for Loid might be powerful, but a racket does not know such emotions. I'm surprised Yor's racket didn't break either. In the end, after losing, Fiona runs off in a very Yuri-like manner. Yor proudly proclaims that she beat Fiona to Loid, and while he's supportive...he doesn't really get the message. There's a bit of an ""and?"" energy coming from him.\n\nAnd yep, going back to the analysis, it was all for nothing! No secret, no nothing, except that the Colonel was a degenerate like all of us. Loid is in denial at first, but the Handler says that she's ultimately alright with it, which gets Loid to be happy too. And after seeing the photo of the colonel with his family, decides to buy his family some snacks too. I hope we see Loid giving them the snacks next week, because Yor is looking pretty sad! And poor Fiona is practicing tennis in the woods, despite it all being long over.\n\nThat's it for this week! I can't wait for next week - the preview showed us some *interesting* things. One of the most notable things that I saw was what looked like a young Loid! I wonder what that's about?

Anime,izo94fw,zhvq56,"It is sorta funny that modern anime fans are obsessed with frame rates and consistently on-model characters than in the past. In the 90s, anime fans had to put up with fans of Western animation slagging anime's lower frame rate and still frames compared to the domestic productions. As such, 90s anime fans had to school those fans of the finer points of anime's appeal, which was NOT about the frame rates.\n\nOf course, now that the Western 2D animation industry has become so scarce outside of educational cartoons, Fox animation, and the odd offerings on specialty cartoon cable networks, that same attitude ""moar frame rates"" in the 90s has shifted to modern anime.\n\nI think modern anime is extremely technically polished. But I do agree that visual and cinematic experimentation isn't always appreciated as much now, even by those working in the anime industry.

So by what he said, does that mean that Lala uses the Levi family's eyes, as a source of power to give energy to that machine she uses to keep herself young? \n\nIs great to see [Selena helping everyone to escape the guards](https://imgur.com/a/Bp9MjX7) even if the only reason she did it was because she hates Lilia so much. \n\n[Lol, it is hilarious how Aileen treads Elephas like he was just a pet.](https://i.imgur.com/0A6oiTc.png)  [Lol, were did Rachel get that pan?](https://i.imgur.com/0GLoUvG.png) \n\nIs hilarious to see [Aileen shipping Selena and Auguste](https://i.imgur.com/TDK6FGO.png) during that time. \n\n[Ah, of course, Lilia was going to be the final boss blocking Aileen's path to her objective.](https://imgur.com/a/mF7aUVW) \n\nWow, so she tried to steal [Aileen's holy sword. ](https://i.imgur.com/PSaiXfJ.png) It is good to see that Aileen could stop that from happening [by putting Claude's magic to her holy sword,](https://imgur.com/a/F4XTgkl) with the power of love. It sure was great when [she stole Lilia's sword to strike the barrier.](https://imgur.com/a/x1HOxYY) And when  Lilia had a backup plan,[ and was about to kill Elephas and win. \n](https://i.imgur.com/qGWzy0I.png) [Almond came back out of nowhere, and had a main character moment.](https://imgur.com/a/9h8f4cb)\n\nIt sure is nice to see that [right after Elephas deactivated the device,](https://i.imgur.com/DqP1gAu.png) [Lala instantly became old.](https://imgur.com/a/NNaZ1hc) \n\nSo definitely thanks to [some maneuvering from Cedric](https://imgur.com/a/KlwtxH1) Pierre has fallen ill and now [Claude is the Emperor.](https://imgur.com/a/vJjlcy6)\n\nIs hilarious that although[ Leicester and Marcus](https://imgur.com/a/MspOkYF) had a bigger role in the original stories, thanks to Lilia not only they were reduce to background characters, but also became criminals too. \n\nWell, it is great that Cedric could make some amends for his previous actions [to start his redemption path](https://i.imgur.com/2NVxIKp.png)  and that h[e now knows that Lilia is a manipulative heartless bitch that will try to control everyone around her like they were mere puppets.](https://i.imgur.com/Qx4jzN5.png) If it was any other character I would be surprised that he was still in love with her, but well, rapist trash belongs to trash so they are perfect for each other. \n\nAnyway, it is great to see that after [Aileen and Claude were finally reunited](https://imgur.com/a/orF3khr) [Claude made a public announcement about their marriage](https://i.imgur.com/91EZB5e.png) [got Lala and Pierre ship out of town,](https://i.imgur.com/3Y5fzNW.png) and not just liberated [the prisoned Levi family members,](https://i.imgur.com/SRgB9o7.png)  but also promised to paid reparations for all their suffering. \n\n[Is great to see Almond practicing for the weeding.](https://i.imgur.com/gopNrdL.png) [It is great that Claude healed Elephas left eye.](https://imgur.com/a/lptMBjA)\n\nLol, so [Cedric and Lilia are going to prison,](https://i.imgur.com/F9AIovK.png) but before that, Aileen and Claude [made them see](https://i.imgur.com/mdGcu8u.png) [their weeding,](https://imgur.com/a/7rpKpxL)  I bet that was Aileen's idea. \n\nWell, as they are going to prison that means that what Lilia did is now public knowledge, hopefully she cannot do much now, and with this conclusion that involve other people intead of just Aileen she realizes that everyone there is alive. \n\n[Anyway, that was such a wonderful way to ended that wedding.](https://imgur.com/a/TRiUuqe)   \n\nI must say that this was one of my favorite shows on this season, I will definitely be getting the light novels after this.",1670696066,t3_zhuqgq,/r/anime/comments/zhuqgq/akuyaku_reijou_nano_de_last_boss_wo/izoong6/
Anime,izpj0cc,zhuqgq,"The first arc was the peak of this show.  After the arc, the show became a total mess.  Plot lines rushed, awful editing that makes it seem that characters besides Claude are able to teleport.  Should have taken their time with this story with a two cour season instead of rushing the material.\n\nAlso, they split Aileen and Claude up far too much after that first arc.  One of the best things was their chemistry, and if you rarely have them on scenes together,  the show suffers.  None of the other characters are as interesting.   Only Lilia had a chance at being an interesting character, but because the story is rushed, we don't learn much about her and don't get to see her being a true villain.\n\n5/10",1670708608,t3_zhuqgq,/r/anime/comments/zhuqgq/akuyaku_reijou_nano_de_last_boss_wo/izpj0cc/

(Ergo the slap.) \n\nThere is a line between being strong and inauthentic and I think a lot of Aileen's problems was her coming across as manipulative which weren't earning Claudes trust, she didn't feel like the same character from the first arc, who was strong, but also kind to go with her cunning. It was an example of ""Good is Not Nice"" so to speak.\n\nAnyway its all happy ever after I guess, and we also know why Cedric turned out such as ass seeing as his grandmother enslaved a sorcery family just to preserve her youth he's had an example of being raised by trash women and guys that go along with trash women.\n\nI also wish he would have disowned Lilia instead of saying, I won't go along but I love you.",1670730714,t3_zhuqgq,/r/anime/comments/zhuqgq/akuyaku_reijou_nano_de_last_boss_wo/izqsf6f/

It was a shame they spent so much time apart but the fact I enjoyed them so much just shows how strong and good of a ship they are.\n\nJust a fantastic time and by far the show I enjoyed the most this season.

Anime,izo1kqt,zhuqgq,"Aileen wakes up in a cell and in handcuffs...which for her is old hat at this point. Like just the look on her face like she's not surprised at all because she's so used to it. Although when you've got Holy Sword Maiden powers, nothing can hold you back!  \n  \nI guess we're meant to sympathize with Elephas a little in that he was being controlled by the Dowager Empress for the sake of his family who were being held hostage at her whim, and then he became another Lilia simp (and Aileen is not about to hear yet another sappy story about someone falling in love with Lilia) which screwed him over. Aileen may never forgive him for what he did to Almond or her, but she can still use him if he begs hard enough. Although to his credit, ripping out his own eye so they can use it to save Claude is a pretty strong start to redeeming himself.  \n  \nOh, so the Dowager Empress doesn't just have anime genes. She was literally holding a bunch of sorcerers hostage just so she could continue to look young. Which set up an amazing payoff at the end when the old hag is forced to look like she really is in all her decrepit glory.   \n  \nSelena is finally on the heroes' side, even if it's just to spite Lilia. Although it seems like she does have some affection for Auguste to that can sway her. Even Aileen ships it now!  \n  \nI'm only mildly disappointed we didn't get to see Rachel hit someone over the head with that frying pan.  \n  \nWell, now Aileen also has to head off a demon invasion by saving Claude, not that she needs even more motivation. But it was also nice to see Bezelbuth bond with Aileens' subordinates. Humans are stupid, but they're kind, caring, and loving through that stupidity at times.  \n  \nIt was always going to come down to Aileen vs Lilia, and Lilia now has a Holy Sword she gained through another romance route, and they're fairly evenly matched. Lilia even tries to pull a reverse of what happened between them in the first arc by absorbing her Holy Sword back from Aileen. But Aileen has true love and the power of her Demon Lord lover backing her up that lets her overcome Lilia.   \n  \nBut the real MVP was none other than...Almond! Who Elephas put in suspended animation and was freed by Cedric! And how dishes out a surprise special move to break the door down and deliver another defeat for Lilia! That's our Almond!  \n  \nJeez, even to the bitter end they're trying to execute Aileen. But no perfect moment for Claude to make his comeback and make it clear he's in charge now, and it's time for all the guilty parties to get their just desserts. Which includes Cedric who willingly exposes himself and Lilia, finally showing some proper backbone even if he still loves Lilia in spite of everything. And Lilia is left wondering how this is all happening as her life crumbles around her. Serves her right, now she really has to deal with the reality of living in this world.  \n  \nAll's well that ends well...Claude and Aileen are reunited, Elephas' family is free (and Claude restores his eye), the Emperor and the Dowager Empress are basically getting kicked out and exiled, and Cedric and Lilia are heading off to prison together. Bonus points for having the two of them attend Aileen and Cedric's wedding while still handcuffed.  \n  \nBut the best way to cap off the ending is Aileen and Cedric finally wed, with their happy ending assured! I can't think of a better conclusion for the show than these two together, minus the fact that we never got a full kiss on the lips. But Aileen and Cedric found love and happiness in each other, and that's all I could really ask for.",1670686563,t3_zhuqgq,/r/anime/comments/zhuqgq/akuyaku_reijou_nano_de_last_boss_wo/izo1kqt/

Much detail is offered: he is a good disputer, **gives men the understanding of the voices of birds, bullocks, dogs, and other creatures**, and of the noise of the waters too, and gives true answers concerning things to come. He is depicted in 19th and 20th century occultist illustrations as **appearing in the form of the black bird called a thrush**, but soon he changes his shape into a man that has a sharp sword in his hand. When answering questions he seems to stand on burning ashes or coals. The title ""President"" of Hell would suggest a parallel with the presiding officer of a college or convocation, which are the only pre-modern uses of the term. Camio's name seems to be taken from the biblical first murderer, Cain.\n\nCamui's bloodline ability is, of course, the power to speak to animals.

Lied's training under Robin gave him the concentration to use his bloodline ability to jump from one demon to another all to find his target, and even Bachiko's ""training"" to both of the boys also comes in handy as her personal maids Iruminati and Lindy return to put on a show for Kerori!

Anime,izntw6f,zhs1no,"Well, at least the Dorodoro Brothers are honest enough to admit when they've lost and accept it...at least until they demand a rematch, but I guess Azz and Sabro get more points out of it anyways. Although hilariously they're both still misunderstanding the master at the heart of the conflict between them is, and I genuinely wonder if they'll ever clear that up at this point.  \n  \nIt's the second day of the Harvest Festival, Eiko and her gal pal is sleeping in a tree, and Iruma and Lead are dead last. But it's done nothing to dampen their enthusiasm! Although poor Iruma is feeling guilty that he ate a lot of their ingredients, but Elizabetta probably would have taken those too.  \n  \nI think most people had it pegged that Iruma and Lead would need the Legend Leaf to win this, but to find out the truth about it they'll need the help of the creatures of the forest...and the only one who can talk to them is Camui. Time to pay a visit to Queen Keroli and her kingdom of simps and cute (and ferocious) animals!  \n  \nMan, Keroli really basking in the glow and power of being a queen with absolute authority, power, and regal beauty. Nao Toyama really nailing what it means to be an ice queen with sensual yet firm authority in her voice. She's not about to let Iruma and Lead get help without offering something in return!  \n  \nAnd of course, this being a Keroli segment, the chances of Iruma crossdressing are surprisingly high. And thus Lindy and Iruminatti make a return appearance, complete with a music video of them dancing! And it's surprisingly well-animated and cute!  \n  \nKeroli isn't just a great Dem-Doll in her own right, she's also a fan! And that means she enjoys watching performances, and it's a great stress reliever when she's about to hit her Evil Cycle. Although what would her Evil Cycle look like? Pure ice queen? Would she freeze everything around her?  \n  \nAnd then we get a sudden animal music number that was also adorable. I don't know why it had to involve a divorced housewife and a mother-in-law, but at least it gave them an idea of what they need to do for the Legend Leaf.  \n  \nKeroli probably planning their next idol performance for her personal pleasure.  \n  \nWith the teachers exhausted and more students forfeiting, it's up to the student council to pick up the slack! Which is basically just an excuse to give Ameri more screen time, not that we mind.  \n  \nOf course Ameri was hoping for an excuse to see Iruma, but their reunion will have to wait for a more appropriate time. But she still believes he can turn things around despite being dead last. And her female subordinate can totally tell she has the hots for Iruma.   \n  \nI love how Ameri seemingly just kicked herself to victory in the original Harvest Festival.   \n  \nNow I kind of feel bad for Ameri if she doesn't get a bouquet...although if she'll take it as a proposal, maybe it's better for Iruma to wait for later on that front.  \n  \nI'm not surprised Jazz and Allocer are running a betting game on the Harvest Festival so much as I'm surprised they already quit. I guess we'll see what happened in the next episode, but I suspect Furfur won't let them live it down.  \n  \nSu-ki-ma!

Either that means there’s 3 rank events they can participate in, or it’s possible to go up two ranks. I don’t see Elizabetta going up two ranks in this event, and I would be curious if Jazz and Allocer could, but playing safe is probably the right call.
