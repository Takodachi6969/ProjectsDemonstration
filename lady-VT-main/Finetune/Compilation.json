I think if you guys really really thought about it,"}, {"prompt": "you would have been like,", "completion": "hmm, why is Ina taking dance lessons like four days a week?"}, {"prompt": "But yeah,", "completion": "I worked really really hard to be able to dance and sing for you guys live.

Yeah,"}, {"prompt": "because previously we had to do a lot more pre-recorded stuff too because of technology and stuff,", "completion": "trying to figure it all out.

But yeah."}, {"prompt": "And because of that,", "completion": "when I realized my guests had to be in the studio as well super super early in the morning, I think I had to be in the studio by like 7am in the morning because it was noon when the live was live and with the two whole bunch of checking and one last rehearsal."}, {"prompt": "And realizing that I had to have three guests,", "completion": "two of them which I have not met in person yet.

Maybe not,"}, {"prompt": "I'm not too sure.", "completion": "I never looked really closely at their ears.

Now,"}, {"prompt": "those are my two favorites,", "completion": "but I thought that when it came to, What would that be in English?"}, {"prompt": "I keep using the Japanese word for it.", "completion": "Because that's where I learned it. Staging,"}, {"prompt": "performance,", "completion": "and shitsu. So it's kind of like,"}, {"prompt": "what would you call it in English?", "completion": "That's what, what should I call it?"}, {"prompt": "English Google tells me,", "completion": "but. Not choreo,"}, {"prompt": "but like the whole,", "completion": "Enshuts is more like the whole package. Like how like a director."}, {"prompt": "Or like,", "completion": "you know, presents everything in like a whole package."}, {"prompt": "Production,", "completion": "performance, direction,"}, {"prompt": "something like that.", "completion": "Somewhere along the line. Production,"}, {"prompt": "something like that.", "completion": "Enshuts. Yeah,"}, {"prompt": "so staging is probably the closest word to it.", "completion": "But yeah, um,"}, {"prompt": "so like you guys saw the big stage where I sang Monochrome,", "completion": "right? That's actually not like my solo stage."}, {"prompt": "It's a stage specially made for us,", "completion": "EN members.

I'm not sure if the others are also going to use it,"}, {"prompt": "but.", "completion": "But yeah, it's such a cool stage."}, {"prompt": "Yeah,", "completion": "that's also been, you know,"}, {"prompt": "in the works for solo.", "completion": "But yeah, it's an amazing stage."}, {"prompt": "And I thought,", "completion": "I think originally the plan was to sing Monochrome first. And then it was unravel and then if."}, {"prompt": "But then after I saw the stage,", "completion": "I was like, Staff-san,"}, {"prompt": "I think I need to switch the songs around.", "completion": "If has to go first in the tranquil Salt Lake stage. And need to do Monochrome in the EN stage."}, {"prompt": "And it was perfect.", "completion": "Perfect. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Honestly, like after the stream ended,"}, {"prompt": "like everyone was just like,", "completion": "And then like the lead staff director-san was like, I was like,"}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "thank you. Thank you."}, {"prompt": "But I was super,", "completion": "super, super well done."}, {"prompt": "Staff-san all worked so,", "completion": "so hard. And I tried my best."}, {"prompt": "Dan-sensei was also there cheering me on.", "completion": "Gemma and other EN staff cheering me on. It all worked out."}, {"prompt": "I'm happy how it turned out.", "completion": "I think it worked out well. But yeah,"}, {"prompt": "Monochrome and If.", "completion": "The two songs look definitely. I wasn't even sure if I could sing."}, {"prompt": "If for example,", "completion": "because you know, it's like a game song."}, {"prompt": "Like a song from a game,", "completion": "but apparently it was okay. I was like,"}, {"prompt": "okay,", "completion": "say less, I will sing it."}, {"prompt": "But that was the one song.", "completion": "Even my Dan-sensei was like, Are you sure you can do this?"}, {"prompt": "In a time,", "completion": "this is like six minutes long. In a time,"}, {"prompt": "this is six minutes long.", "completion": "Because usually those songs are like three, three and a half to four minutes."}, {"prompt": "But if it was like six minutes or something.", "completion": "Yeah, but it worked out."}, {"prompt": "It worked out.", "completion": "I remember there were actually some moves that were supposed to be different. But one thing sensei told me a lot was like,"}, {"prompt": "even if you think you can't like make the next move and stuff,", "completion": "just be confident because you know, the viewers won't know what the moves are supposed to be."}, {"prompt": "So as long as you're confident and looks graceful and beautiful,", "completion": "it's all good. Improvise."}, {"prompt": "Confidence.", "completion": "And you know, at the very least I can do is move to the beat,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "Like as long as I make some graceful movement to the beat, it's okay."}, {"prompt": "Yeah,", "completion": "we have to simplify some of the moves, but I feel like if I could,"}, {"prompt": "you know,", "completion": "have another chance at it, I could definitely practice more and get the moves down 100%."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I feel like I definitely could have done more snappy or movements and like bigger graceful movements. You know,"}, {"prompt": "I did my best.", "completion": "I think I'm satisfied with how it went. You know,"}, {"prompt": "now I proved to you guys I can dance,", "completion": "okay? I can dance."}, {"prompt": "I think I probably looked really bad with,", "completion": "especially with, was it digital girl for Chiara's birthday live last year?"}, {"prompt": "I think I probably looked really bad with,", "completion": "especially with the digital girl for Chiara's birthday live last year.

So I didn't get to go to the concert."}, {"prompt": "I should say proper thank you goodbye before,", "completion": "before they had to leave. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "But afterwards,", "completion": "I think, I think,"}, {"prompt": "yeah,", "completion": "we were able to treat, at least whoever was left to some lunch,"}, {"prompt": "bento lunches and stuff,", "completion": "so all the staffs down. Because we ended kind of like past lunchtime."}, {"prompt": "So yeah,", "completion": "we all got some bento and stuff. It was good."}, {"prompt": "Why didn't I try the worm?", "completion": "I would have gotten bop so hard. I wanted to hear that."}, {"prompt": "I wanted to hear that.", "completion": "It was perfect.

They were really attached to me,"}, {"prompt": "so I really wanted to adopt them.", "completion": "And I did in my dream. I also had like a weird dream as well."}, {"prompt": "The other day,", "completion": "it was like, it somehow caught two salmon,"}, {"prompt": "like live salmon.", "completion": "I was keeping them in my bathtub. I don't know."}, {"prompt": "It's just,", "completion": "I don't know, somehow I caught two big salmon and they were in my bathtub."}, {"prompt": "And like,", "completion": "and like one of them had like, was like soapy,"}, {"prompt": "like they were,", "completion": "they were like kept in soap or something. So I had to like wash them."}, {"prompt": "I don't know.", "completion": "My dreams are really weird. Hahaha."}, {"prompt": "Salmon don't live that long,", "completion": "no! But yeah,"}, {"prompt": "they were,", "completion": "they were pretty big salmon. I don't even know how I knew they were salmon,"}, {"prompt": "cause I don't know what fish look like without,", "completion": "you know, it being like sashimi or something."}, {"prompt": "But I somehow knew,", "completion": "like in my dream, they were salmon."}, {"prompt": "Hahaha.", "completion": "Hahaha. I don't know what they look like,"}, {"prompt": "but in my dream,", "completion": "they were like, yup,"}, {"prompt": "those are salmon,", "completion": "alright. And no,"}, {"prompt": "it wasn't like the Splatoon salmon.", "completion": "It's literally like actual fish swimming salmon. Yeah,"}, {"prompt": "it was weird.", "completion": "But apparently I was taking care of them in the bathtub. Do you guys ever have like a dream where your house is technically like this giant,"}, {"prompt": "giant,", "completion": "giant mansion full of like all kinds of weird rooms and stuff? And like some of the rooms were,"}, {"prompt": "what should I say,", "completion": "like like hidden storage and then you have to go through some of the rooms to get to another room. But then like you like remember that,"}, {"prompt": "you know,", "completion": "wait, I don't live in a house like this,"}, {"prompt": "but then you remember,", "completion": "it feels so real. It's like your house is a labyrinth,"}, {"prompt": "but then you already,", "completion": "you know, it's familiar to you but not."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "I sometimes think like, sometimes I just have like a really weird dream,"}, {"prompt": "but then at the same time I'm just like,", "completion": "you know, if this dream was just like me taking a peek at Isekai self of myself."}, {"prompt": "Man,", "completion": "they're having some, they're having fun time,"}, {"prompt": "aren't they?", "completion": "That's what I kind of think, like my dreams are actually me traveling to an Isekai version of myself like very briefly just to see how they live."}, {"prompt": "I'm just like,", "completion": "man, they got two salmon in the bathtub or like,"}, {"prompt": "wow,", "completion": "they got to dub two cats. Yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I'm just like,", "completion": "wow, they're living in the life."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Which is why like I think if I have realistic dreams, I'm not that surprised because,"}, {"prompt": "you know,", "completion": "like there's a lot of like infinite timelines. And it's like I traveled to one very close to me just briefly,"}, {"prompt": "you know,", "completion": "infinite timelines. I just peeked into the closer ones compared to like further one with two salmon."}, {"prompt": "Yeah,", "completion": "except it's weird because like I don't know what I look like in the Isekai. Have you guys ever wondered,"}, {"prompt": "I mean,", "completion": "it's always the case, right?"}, {"prompt": "Like when you get Isekai,", "completion": "you don't exactly look the same as you do right now. Like I don't know what I look like in the Isekais."}, {"prompt": "Have you guys ever seen yourself in the mirror in like an Isekai?", "completion": "I don't think I ever have. But like it's just,"}, {"prompt": "it's just a fun thing to think about sometimes.", "completion": "Like I don't think I've ever remember seeing myself in the mirror. Like what if dreams are really just us peeking into the different worlds,"}, {"prompt": "even though they may seem really unreal,", "completion": "it might be real in that world. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "That's why I look forward to seeing dreams.", "completion": "I guess like that's why I also accept nightmares as it is because even if it's a nightmare, like not all Isekais are good,"}, {"prompt": "you know.", "completion": "Like there will be times where my Isekai self will be going through hard troubles and stuff or there might be like really happy things going on and stuff. It's just like a really interesting story to kind of see unfold."}, {"prompt": "But the most frustrating ones are actually the ones where I'm about to travel and then like I like forget to bring my luggage to the airport or something like that.", "completion": "I just gotta say that that Isekai's Inna, you're dumb dumb."}, {"prompt": "You're supposed to,", "completion": "you're supposed to bring your luggage all the time. How can you forget?"}, {"prompt": "But you know,", "completion": "it's always like a what if situation, right?"}, {"prompt": "An infinite number of timelines.", "completion": "There will be a timeline where Inna of the Isekai brings the luggage to the airport and there will be times where Inna of the Isekai does not bring the luggage to the airport. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Exactly.", "completion": "You like the Okabelintaro of porn? Isekai Ponguru."}, {"prompt": "That's right.", "completion": "Speaking of which, I think I'm gonna have enough collab today,"}, {"prompt": "later tonight with Am\u00e9.", "completion": "The Iris? From what I remember?"}, {"prompt": "Mmm,", "completion": "Mario Party. Yes."}, {"prompt": "Mmm,", "completion": "that's right. Yeah,"}, {"prompt": "it's gonna be fun.", "completion": "To the little over two Am\u00e9's place. We're gonna have some offline Mario Party."}, {"prompt": "Isn't it exciting?", "completion": "I'm gonna suggest that whoever loses buys dinner. Whoever loses buys dinner."}, {"prompt": "I think that'll be great.", "completion": "Unhinged Inna coming back. What do you mean unhinged?"}, {"prompt": "I think I was just tired during the collab with Kalei.", "completion": "It was right after the 3D stream. I was like,"}, {"prompt": "you know what,", "completion": "I'm gonna be potato for the entire day tomorrow. And that couldn't be because I had other rehearsals that I had to be at."}, {"prompt": "I was tired and I was like,", "completion": "Kalei, let's go."}, {"prompt": "But then again,", "completion": "can you guys blame me? He's saying Kalei is so fun."}, {"prompt": "Like how she reacts,", "completion": "right? It's just so fun."}, {"prompt": "I can't help it.", "completion": "It's like an international thing that everyone agrees on. Exactly,"}, {"prompt": "exactly.", "completion": "You can't blame me. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Man,", "completion": "I can't wait for Kiaras and Kalei. I heard that Kiaras is not feeling too good."}, {"prompt": "I hope she gets better.", "completion": "Because we only have like what? Thursday,"}, {"prompt": "Friday,", "completion": "Saturday. Christmas on Saturday,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "Like three days? Less than three days?"}, {"prompt": "So yeah,", "completion": "no worries. I hope she just rests until the time comes."}, {"prompt": "Kiaras said I was wearing a lab coat.", "completion": "Okay, to explain."}, {"prompt": "So I ordered some taiyaki,", "completion": "right? Except they only sold it in like a pack of five."}, {"prompt": "But I couldn't eat it all.", "completion": "So I was like, does anyone want taiyaki?"}, {"prompt": "I think she just like ended her stream and she was like,", "completion": "oh yeah. You know,"}, {"prompt": "I'll take one.", "completion": "So I brought one down to her. Except I didn't want to wear like my thick jacket going outside."}, {"prompt": "But then,", "completion": "like I didn't have anything else. So I have this like one kind of like button up dress thing."}, {"prompt": "And it's just like all white.", "completion": "And I just like put that on top of whatever I was wearing to go. And I guess it kind of looked like a lab coat."}, {"prompt": "Hmm.", "completion": "I didn't want to be cold. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "But it kind of looked like I was a mad scientist outside Punguru.", "completion": "We totally make that a thing for this channel outside Punguru. You know,"}, {"prompt": "I've like done that before many,", "completion": "many, many years past."}, {"prompt": "You know,", "completion": "I was like, well,"}, {"prompt": "people go to anemic conventions dressed as like so many cool people.", "completion": "But I don't know. I don't know."}, {"prompt": "I don't know cosplay or anything.", "completion": "So I happen to have a lab coat from school. So I just went to anemic convention wearing a lab coat."}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "yeah, I'm a scientist cosplay."}, {"prompt": "Just wearing normal clothes.", "completion": "Yeah, scientist."}, {"prompt": "That's the best cosplay I've ever done.", "completion": "Just wearing a lab coat. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "It was so,", "completion": "so long ago. I don't even remember if like Steins' cake was a thing."}, {"prompt": "I just wore a lab coat.", "completion": "I was like, yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I think actually maybe.", "completion": "I don't know. Who knows."}, {"prompt": "I was a really little little child with no allowance money for cosplay.", "completion": "I just wore a lab coat. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Totally works,", "completion": "right? I blended in with people wearing cosplay."}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "yeah, scientist."}, {"prompt": "All these apex hadn't seek.", "completion": "I was like, yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I'm a scientist.", "completion": "I was like, yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I'm a scientist.", "completion": "I was like, yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I'm a scientist.", "completion": "I was like, yeah,"}, {"prompt": "I'm a scientist.", "completion": "All these apex hadn't seek. Oh yeah,"}, {"prompt": "that was so funny.", "completion": "Okay, so we did like a little,"}, {"prompt": "what should I say,", "completion": "like a rehearsal. Not really a rehearsal,"}, {"prompt": "but just kind of like,", "completion": "see where we're supposed to be hiding and stuff. Like I could not find a good spot."}, {"prompt": "Like even when I was looking around.", "completion": "And then when I asked, Ollie was like,"}, {"prompt": "yeah,", "completion": "you can use skins for whoever you use. I was like,"}, {"prompt": "okay,", "completion": "okay, like the champion I use a lot is Pathfinder."}, {"prompt": "We are allowed to use Pathfinder.", "completion": "And I was looking through all the skins that Pathfinder had. And I think I just had enough like whatever credit to get the camouflage skin for Pathfinder."}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "okay, okay,"}, {"prompt": "I have a chance.", "completion": "I have a chance. Champion,"}, {"prompt": "what are they called?", "completion": "Heroes champions? All the games are different."}, {"prompt": "Challengers?", "completion": "What are they called in Apex? Legends?"}, {"prompt": "Legends.", "completion": "Oh, okay,"}, {"prompt": "legends.", "completion": "Okay. Anyways,"}, {"prompt": "Predators.", "completion": "I'm not a Predator. But yeah,"}, {"prompt": "that's why,", "completion": "that's why for the real deal, I'll say,"}, {"prompt": "okay,", "completion": "surely if I use Pathfinder and I use the Kamo skin, I can find like a corner where I'll be able to hide."}, {"prompt": "And actually,", "completion": "like I've seen, it was like a different game,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "I forget what game it was. But there was ones where like a YouTuber or like a streamer,"}, {"prompt": "they did like a hide and seek content.", "completion": "It was like a battle royale too. I forget what game."}, {"prompt": "But there were times where they had to do,", "completion": "they had like the fans join in for hide and seek thing. And from what I learned from watching that like video and stuff,"}, {"prompt": "was the fact that people don't usually look up.", "completion": "Yeah. So it was very important that I found the place that was not at eye level."}, {"prompt": "That was the first thing.", "completion": "So that's why I kind of went up to the roofs. And luckily in the swamps,"}, {"prompt": "there's a lot of like plants on the top of the roof.", "completion": "So I went there and I was unsure where, like what would be a good kind of spot that has a little bit of a plant,"}, {"prompt": "some plant life,", "completion": "but it's not too obvious. Like there's like a roof with like two open roofs,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "There's a lot of plants there, but that's very obvious."}, {"prompt": "Like you can definitely see.", "completion": "So I was trying to find like a little spot where I could just like kind of like crouch. And like there's a little bit of little bit of plants and like maybe a wall or something or corner."}, {"prompt": "And I found that little corner on the roof.", "completion": "And after I saw the screenshot, like of all the looking at me,"}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "man, that was a good spot."}, {"prompt": "Oh,", "completion": "that was that was that was pretty good. That was was actually well thought out."}, {"prompt": "Now I was like,", "completion": "yeah, that was that was pretty good."}, {"prompt": "I mean,", "completion": "I think I got some close calls where I actually saw like someone walk below me because there's like a little crack between the roofs where I could see people running around. But I saw some people running around and stuff."}, {"prompt": "And when I look back at all these perspective,", "completion": "like people were running on the roof and stuff. But then what was really good was the fact that I was against the wall of like a second,"}, {"prompt": "like two layers of roofs.", "completion": "So if he jumped over to get down to the lower roof where I was standing on, and if he didn't look back,"}, {"prompt": "he wouldn't see me.", "completion": "So like if he didn't do a really thorough 360 around the smaller roof, I was like,"}, {"prompt": "I am so good.", "completion": "Yeah. And it was kind of hard to see."}, {"prompt": "I was living in Angola.", "completion": "It was kind of hard to see if you were like on the ground too. So just very nice."}, {"prompt": "The second hiding spot,", "completion": "I was out of time. I had already given up because I was literally in the view of the door."}, {"prompt": "If you open the door,", "completion": "if you looked, you would have seen me."}, {"prompt": "And when I looked at the end of the hide and seek time over,", "completion": "I saw the door open. So someone has entered the building and looked around and have not spotted me,"}, {"prompt": "which was surprising because I was literally right there.", "completion": "But I think my plan for the second one was actually trying to sneak on top of one of the things sticking out of the wall. It kind of like squished myself somehow,"}, {"prompt": "like find a foothold to stand in front of one of the small boxes or something that was sticking out of the wall.", "completion": "And just kind of like sitting there. But I feel like if that didn't work,"}, {"prompt": "I probably would have been caught.", "completion": "Because it's kind of obvious if you actually go in and look. But I could not find a foothold at the right time."}, {"prompt": "And I ran out of time.", "completion": "So I was like, okay,"}, {"prompt": "best thing I can do is probably hide in this corner and pray.", "completion": "And make sure that I don't look around because Pathfinder has like the little lens on the front, right?"}, {"prompt": "But the back is like the camel skin especially.", "completion": "It's just like really good for hiding. So I was like,"}, {"prompt": "okay,", "completion": "if I'm lucky, they won't see me because they will be in a hurry to walk around if it's not obvious."}, {"prompt": "So yeah,", "completion": "so I crouched. I looked into the wall so that the colors will blend in with the wood and kind of like the moss texture."}, {"prompt": "And I feel like I worked out.", "completion": "Honestly, I feel like if they wanted it to be a little easy,"}, {"prompt": "they probably should have told us to not use skins or,", "completion": "you know, they can't use Pathfinder."}, {"prompt": "But it worked out.", "completion": "It worked out. Somehow they did not find me."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "What about the Louie incident? I just got excited that I could shoot a gun and I hit someone and I did not realize that Louie was on my team."}, {"prompt": "Because,", "completion": "okay, to my defense,"}, {"prompt": "for example,", "completion": "to my defense, I only did not attack if I saw them holding a gun,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "But I think the one time that I saw her, she,"}, {"prompt": "she threw a weapon and she was running.", "completion": "And it was right after we had a whole bunch of group battle like in the area, right?"}, {"prompt": "Like I only did not attack because I can't see the names of everyone.", "completion": "So I only don't attack if I didn't see the gun out. Like if you had the gun out,"}, {"prompt": "I did not shoot you,", "completion": "but if you were just running without your weapon out. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "That's why I got really, really scared because like the first footsteps I heard,"}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "Are they enemy or friend? But I saw that they had a gun and I was like,"}, {"prompt": "oh,", "completion": "okay, okay."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "How was the boxing match? I got bopped."}, {"prompt": "I think I didn't even get to go into the actual ring.", "completion": "I, um,"}, {"prompt": "what's it?", "completion": "I think, I think I got bopped by Gura."}, {"prompt": "She punched me to death.", "completion": "It's fine. If I had to die by anyone else's hand,"}, {"prompt": "it had to be Gura.", "completion": "Oh yeah. You guys,"}, {"prompt": "I kind of wish I stream because the moment I found Kobo at the end,", "completion": "it was hilarious because there was like a, I walked around trying to find someone,"}, {"prompt": "find the last person,", "completion": "right? I walked,"}, {"prompt": "I walked,", "completion": "I turned around. I saw her for a split second."}, {"prompt": "I think she was,", "completion": "was she Pathfinder? I think she was Pathfinder."}, {"prompt": "So I walked around and looked and there was like a Pathfinder sitting.", "completion": "I was like, huh?"}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "huh? And then like it chopped at me."}, {"prompt": "I was like,", "completion": "oh my god, I'm supposed to,"}, {"prompt": "I'm supposed to.", "completion": "But yeah, that was,"}, {"prompt": "that was funny.", "completion": "There was like a good five seconds of just us staring at each other and then chaos. She wasn't even hiding that like,"}, {"prompt": "like in a corner or anything.", "completion": "She was just hiding like out on one of the platforms and she blended in because she was Pathfinder. There was like a whole bunch of mech looking stuff around her."}, {"prompt": "But yeah,", "completion": "there was like a small pause, five seconds and then chaos."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And I kind of, I kind of regret not picking up a separate gun because I,"}, {"prompt": "P 2020 was the,", "completion": "was the best weapon I think I had. The other one was like what,"}, {"prompt": "like a,", "completion": "it was one of those like energy weapons that you had to like hold down before it goes when you go, so I didn't really like that."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "And I like the, what's at the recoil is all over the place."}, {"prompt": "You know a lot of time to loop too.", "completion": "Why do you think I'm bad at, you know,"}, {"prompt": "battle royale shooting games?", "completion": "If I had a sniper rifle though, that would have been a different question."}, {"prompt": "Okay.", "completion": "Yeah, I should have,"}, {"prompt": "I should have just grabbed the sniper rifle.", "completion": "You can miss from further away. I don't know."}, {"prompt": "I prefer just,", "completion": "you know, if I were like a technical support,"}, {"prompt": "technical support,", "completion": "I'd rather just help my teammates by sniping from afar. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Oh,", "completion": "you know, I'm not a good sniper."}, {"prompt": "I'm not a good sniper.", "completion": "I'm not a good sniper. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Oh,", "completion": "you know, I was watching just random videos too on YouTube."}, {"prompt": "Just as I,", "completion": "just as I said, I didn't watch."}, {"prompt": "There's a game called,", "completion": "what's it, ARMA."}, {"prompt": "Wouldn't that be so interesting to do like two,", "completion": "like, like a big hollow versus hollow collab?"}, {"prompt": "Oh,", "completion": "that would be so fun. I was watching it."}, {"prompt": "Man,", "completion": "that looks fun, but it also looks difficult."}, {"prompt": "That would be such a big collab too.", "completion": "And it's so intense. I was watching like a,"}, {"prompt": "what was it?", "completion": "It was like a, it was a big group of people,"}, {"prompt": "but yeah.", "completion": "Yeah. I feel like it is definitely difficult to learn because there's like a whole bunch of controls for all the vehicles and all the different,"}, {"prompt": "you know,", "completion": "types of stuff. Escape from Tarkov?"}, {"prompt": "Oh,", "completion": "I don't know. I don't think,"}, {"prompt": "I don't think I would survive that well in that game.", "completion": "It seems too difficult for me. There are easier games that are similar though."}, {"prompt": "That would be true.", "completion": "What if like, oh,"}, {"prompt": "I wonder if,", "completion": "like, I guess Apex doesn't really have like a big 50 versus 50 or something like big scale stuff,"}, {"prompt": "right?", "completion": "I feel like Apex would be a really fun one to do, but hmm."}, {"prompt": "Battlefield Fortnite?", "completion": "Battlefield? I don't know."}, {"prompt": "I feel like my laptop might explode playing Battlefield.", "completion": "But yeah. You can make custom games now on Apex."}, {"prompt": "But can anyone make custom games on Apex now?", "completion": "Because I know last time it was only like you have to have like a special English game. That'd be fun."}, {"prompt": "That means I can play with chat.", "completion": "I can watch you guys play. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "That would be super fun.", "completion": "I guess I'll go. Since I have Apex installed in the laptop,"}, {"prompt": "I'll see like what kind of settings you can make with the Apex stuff.", "completion": "I mean, I'm here too."}, {"prompt": "Maybe you can do like a collab with playing with viewers or something.", "completion": "Hmm. That'd be fine."}, {"prompt": "A-chan,", "completion": "koncha, koncha!"}, {"prompt": "Waio!", "completion": "Waio? Waio!"}, {"prompt": "Wata asa ta yo!", "completion": "Yeah. This video is a while since..."}, {"prompt": "By a while,", "completion": "I mean like ages since I did a one-on-one collab with Dami too. I don't know."}, {"prompt": "It's like,", "completion": "Ame in a way is very similar to me, right?"}, {"prompt": "Well,", "completion": "at least like Dami I know is very similar to me in a way. So,"}, {"prompt": "collabing with her is like clubbing with myself.", "completion": "Yeah. It hasn't been two years?"}, {"prompt": "Oh my goodness.", "completion": "I don't know. It's like once you get to like a certain comfort level with someone,"}, {"prompt": "you just don't realize you haven't like one-on-one collabed in that long.", "completion": "Is it just me? I don't know."}, {"prompt": "Maybe it's just me,", "completion": "but like sometimes I just realize like... We haven't really one-on-one collabed in a while."}, {"prompt": "Especially if it's like both of us are not the ones to like initiate collabs.", "completion": "Yeah. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Yeah,", "completion": "that's like with myth like in general. Usually if I do like one-on-one collab,"}, {"prompt": "this will usually when they ask me if I want to collab.", "completion": "We've gotten to a point where I'm personally I'm so comfortable with them that doesn't feel like it's been ages since I collab with them. I collab with them."}, {"prompt": "It's just like hanging out with them.", "completion": "I mean if we do like a satsuzan type podcast type kind of stream, like what would you guys want to hear or see?"}, {"prompt": "I'm like brainstorming ideas too because I do want to collab,", "completion": "but it's just like... What?"}, {"prompt": "What?", "completion": "It's like the Romantic scene. Something like that."}, {"prompt": "You had two years to think.", "completion": "Well, I'm so real."}, {"prompt": "Just talk a lot behind the scenes.", "completion": "And some of the things I guess we can't really talk about cause it's like spoiler stuff. A girl's talk."}, {"prompt": "I'm not sure if we're the type where we should be the one-stay crosstalk.", "completion": "Maybe anime talk, the gamer talk,"}, {"prompt": "maybe.", "completion": "Random topic wheel. That's a good idea."}, {"prompt": "Random topics.", "completion": "Talk about Mars. That reminds me,"}, {"prompt": "I really need to finish the artwork for the expo cause I need to get it specially printed.", "completion": "Thanks for the reminder. I'm not sure if we can get it."}, {"prompt": "It's uh...", "completion": "what's it? What?"}, {"prompt": "Tear list?", "completion": "Tear list might be interesting. Maybe we can buy a whole bunch of snacks."}, {"prompt": "And then we can make a tear list.", "completion": "Whole bunch of drinks and snacks. And we can have anime make the tear list as I commentate."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "Or I guess one of the ideas I had when I was going around random place with girl when we first got here was actually to create a new dish out of konbini food. Create new things from konbini stuff,"}, {"prompt": "stuff that you can buy from the konbini.", "completion": "So that there will be a recipe for people who wants to try new food. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Yeah.", "completion": "First konbini cooking. That sounds fun."}, {"prompt": "Or I could get ame to draw.", "completion": "Maybe. Ame shall draw."}, {"prompt": "Or we can also do karaoke too,", "completion": "that's fine. Okay I got some ideas now."}, {"prompt": "That's good ideas.", "completion": "But yeah. Please look forward to the Mario Party stream later."}, {"prompt": "I'm his channel I believe.", "completion": "I gotta go lend her my capture card. Oh yeah she can teach me about terrariums."}, {"prompt": "We could do a terrarium making stream.", "completion": "That'd be nice. I'll probably just like gift it to someone."}, {"prompt": "Maybe.", "completion": "Okay I feel like it's time for a nap. I've been mostly like potato for the last couple of days."}, {"prompt": "I've just been cleaning the room,", "completion": "taking lots of naps, catching up on some other assignments."}, {"prompt": "I gotta do before Gemma just sit down again.", "completion": "But yeah I gotta, I gotta couple more days until I have more dance lessons and practice for the next one."}, {"prompt": "Definitely not a mess collab.", "completion": "So yeah I hope you guys look forward to that schedule. I have no idea."}, {"prompt": "Oh I do have one sponsor to stream in upcoming though since I didn't get to do one when I was on break.", "completion": "It's actually on Saturday like a couple hours before Chiara's 3D debut. So yeah I'll have that schedule later."}, {"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "But that's about it for now. What time it should be 8am JST which is..."}, {"prompt": "3pm PSTPT Pacific time.", "completion": "Somewhat. Will I appear in 3D in the upcoming showcases?"}, {"prompt": "No comment.", "completion": "I'm not spoiling other people's showcases. Yeah."}, {"prompt": "Anyways,", "completion": "thank you. I hope you guys definitely check out Kiwaba in County's 3D showcase this weekend."}, {"prompt": "Yes.", "completion": "Hey guys thank you very much. I hope you guys have a wonderful wonderful wonderful rest of the morning afternoon evening."}, {"prompt": "And I'll see you guys later today or tomorrow whenever it turns out to be for you guys.", "completion": "I'm gonna be proud to be for you guys. A dumbest channel for some fun of collab Mario Party."}, {"prompt": "Thank you.", "completion": "Okay. Bye bye."}, {"prompt": "Bye bye.", "completion": ""}]
