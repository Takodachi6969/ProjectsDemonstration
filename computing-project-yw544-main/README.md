This will probably open up your chrome, upload the content of the repository into the webUI and run LeniaReport for the body of the report.

LeniaEssentials.py composed of essential functions of Lenia written by Bert Chan in his github page: https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia

AnimalsBettter.Json and AnimalsConcise.Json are modified files of lifeforms' data by Bert Chan in his github page: https://github.com/Chakazul/Lenia

LeniaFuncs.py are functions used in the report.

LeniaReports.ipynb contained the content of the report. The entire report could be run within 20 seconds, and contained pop up windows for pregenerated simulation data. If you don't see the pop up, it is most likely hidden behind your browser on a lower layer.

The csv files are pregenerated results of lifeforms that would take too long to run on your machine.
